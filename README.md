# Strategic (Re)Search
Strategic (Re)Search was developed to make undiscovered public knowledge discoverable. We designed this tool to process, analyze, and present research data from thousands of project proposals, summaries, and publications. The goals of this project are to give Research Program Managers the ability to search for potentially undiscovered research, identify subject matter experts, and to present the results in such a way that facilitates identification of potential gaps in research or opportunities for collaboration.

A principal challenge associated with performing and directing research within a mature domain is to establish how all activities relate to past, current, and potential future research studies. Research oftentimes goes undiscovered. Without placing activities within the context of the larger research community, there is a risk of both duplicating the efforts of others and missing collaborative opportunities. This solution was created for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under a technical support services contract for the Long- Term Bridge Performance Program (LTBP).

Technology Stack: Elasticsearch, Flask, Dash, Python.
