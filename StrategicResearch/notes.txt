***need use case
***slide talking about saerch engine
    - use case is to shorten time taken for ordinary search

***need analytics (talk to Abello and Sayad)
	- x number of active projects
	- $y spent in the previous year
	- $z spent in the previous 5 years
	- Top i performing agenies for this search
	- Top j states performing this research
	- k most common element for research topic
	- h most common topics for element

***add strategy to strategic search


ideas:
    - overlay charts on map
    - functionality to allow user to dynamically add categories (from settings page?)
	- Add "analytics boxes" over search results and in Dashboard
