    <abstract>Latex modified concrete (LMC) is used for a bridge deck pavement method that was introduced in Korea in the 2000s, and it is currently the concrete pavement method being used for most highway bridges. It has been recommended that mixing with latex approximately 15% in terms of polymer-cement ratio (P/C ratio) by weight showed no occurrence of cracks with sufficient tensile strength and bond strength of LMC. However, many cracks occur in the actual field mostly due to drying shrinkage of concrete, requiring frequent repair. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of applying a shrinkage reducing agent(SRA) that could reduce plastic shrinkage cracks at early age as well as drying shrinkage cracks of LMC. Based on the test results, it was confirmed that adding a shrinkage reducing agent could secure the durability without affecting the fresh and hardened properties of LMC. The compression strength test results presented a 1.7ï¿½5.7% improvement in strength to the SRA mixture compared to the plain mixture. Length change test results indicated that SRA mix conditions presented more outstanding performance compared to mix conditions with the expansive admixture. The amount of shrinkage reducing agent suitable for achieving performance requirements in length change, crack resistance, chloride ions penetration resistance and scaling resistance, was evaluated as 3% by weight ratio of binding material under the limited condition of the present study.</abstract>

    <abstract>The purposes of this study were to investigate the seasonal variations in the relative permittivity of actual concrete bridge decks of various ages on Korea expressways, and to propose a practical way to calibrate two critical effects, to assess the condition of the concrete bridge decks with better accuracy. For these purposes, fifty-three actual concrete bridge decks on Korea expressways were scanned using an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system, and the relative permittivity of the concrete was evaluated from the GPR data in the field. A statistical analysis showed that the relative permittivity of the concrete bridge decks in Korea are closely correlated with seasonal changes and concrete ages. For concrete bridge decks aged 10ï¿½years or older, the effect of concrete age was not as significant as that of relative humidity of the air on relative permittivity of concrete. Based on the results, a simple calibration process was proposed to suppress the effects of seasonal variation and age of concrete on the measured relative permittivity of the concrete decks on actual bridges. As will be discussed, the resulting relative permittivity method produced better agreement with the current condition of the concrete bridge decks as determined by visual inspection and other complementary methods (energy attenuation of GPR signals and corrosion potential measurements) than without the calibration process.</abstract>

    <abstract>More adaptable geometric form of offshore platforms, counting on the benefits of form-dominant design, is effective to encounter various environmental loads. Offshore triceratops is a new-generation offshore platform, whose conceptual design showed good degree-of-adaptability to ultra-deep-water conditions. Deck is partially isolated from the buoyant legs by ball joints by allowing transfer of partial displacements of buoyant legs to deck but restraining transfer of rotational responses. Prior to the suitability assessment of triceratops for ultra-deep waters, detailed dynamic analysis on the preliminary geometric form is necessary as a proof of validation for design applications. Current study discusses a detailed numeric analysis of triceratops at 2400ï¿½m water depth under regular and irregular waves; preliminary design of both buoyant legs and the deck is also presented. Buoyant Legs are designed as stiffened cylinders and the deck is designed as the integrated truss system. In compliant structures, the role of tethers is of paramount importance. Hence, the stress analysis and fatigue analysis of the tethers are also carried out to assess the service life of the structure. Presented study shall aid offshore engineers and contractors to understand suitability of triceratops, in terms of design and dynamic response behaviour.</abstract>

    <abstract>There are various methods to predict the settlement caused by shallow tunneling, with each method having particular strengths and weaknesses. However, the most important weakness of common methods is the failure to consider all parameters contributing into the settlement. Nowadays, earth pressure balance machines (EPBMs) are commonly applied for tunneling into soft grounds. In this tunneling method, many parameters affect resultant surface settlement, it difficult to estimate the settlement by traditional methods. Soft computing, however, can be devised to cope with such engineering limitations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the soft computing methods of neuro-genetic system (NGS), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and gene expression programming (GEP) to predict maximum surface settlement S(max) caused by tunneling in Shanghai Subway LRT Line 2 project. For this purpose, S(max) is considered as a function of geometric, strength and operational factors, with the factors combined using different methods to reconstruct different models. The results showed that the models with operational factors outperformed other models. Among tested methods, ANFIS and NGS presented the best and the worst forecasts, respectively. With respect to the results of this research, it can be said that, despite the fact that GEP had lower accuracy in comparison to ANFIS, it represented the most suitable method to estimate S(max) because of providing useful mathematical equations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Several state departments of transportation have begun using accelerated bridge construction (ABC) to better serve the traveling public.  Although the primary goal of ABC is to shorten traffic delays, ABC may provide additional opportunities to improve the structural performance standards of bridges under various loads, and ABC may provide structural benefits to alleviate damage from earthquakes.

    Researchers have learned several lessons from ABC seismic studies over the past decade that could benefit conventional cast-in-place (CIP) connection details through the reduction of steel congestion, and through the simplification of construction. However, the lessons learned from successful ABC pocket connections for conventional bridge construction have yet to be tested in the reduction of steel congestion in conventional CIP connections, and research has yet to be accomplished regarding the incorporation of innovative materials, such as shape memory alloys (SMA), in hinge connections.

    The overall objective of this project is to develop a new design and detailing procedure for CIP and precast column pocket connections, for application in both conventional bridge construction and ABC in Nevada.  The intent of this study is to complement previous efforts by developing design guidelines for ABC pocket connections, while incorporating less congested CIP connections based on ABC pocket connection concepts. Furthermore, the study seeks to determine whether steel congestion in CIP can be eliminated, thereby simplifying the construction, while including innovative materials to further enhance the seismic performance of bridge column-footing hinge connections through low-yield copper, aluminum, and manganese (CAM) bars.

    <abstract>The objective of the project is to establish a field method, including a data analysis algorithm, for determining in-place pile lengths. A unique feature of the proposed work is the use of computational modeling to explore the effects of soil type and ground conditions on the sensitivity of the method. The length of each pile supporting a HMTL will be identified through a systematic sensing approach that includes (i) collection and classification of the pertinent foundation designs and soil conditions; (ii) three-dimensional (3D) simulation of dynamic soil-foundation interaction; (iii) parametric studies of the 3D pile vibration problem; (iv) field testing; and (v) analysis-driven data interpretation.</abstract>

    <abstract>MnDOT is constructing a pair of side-by-side bridges on TH 169, one with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) deck reinforcement and the other with conventional epoxy coated steel reinforcement. Because these two bridges will be exposed to the same environmental conditions, will experience very similar traffic, and will be constructed within the same timeframe, a unique opportunity exists to identify and evaluate differences in performance between them. The main goals of the proposed project are to (1) collect the behavior information and response characteristics of the two bridge decks under service loads, (2) examine the short- and long-term durability characteristics of the two bridge decks, and (3) assess the impact of using non-conventional, corrosion-resistant deck reinforcement on maintenance needs and life-cycle cost with a specific interest in including service life-design philosophies.</abstract>

    <abstract>Many Minnesota bridges have older barriers or parapets that met the design code at the time of Construction in the 1950's.  Many of these bridge rails no longer meet current strength and performance requirements.  As MnDOT begins to rehabilitate older existing bridges, a determination needs to be made as to whether the existing older barrier type can remain in place or if it should be rehabilitated or replaced with a newer style barrier.
    The first step is to document the time periods and number of structures in the state that have post &amp; beam, type G, type J, and type F barriers.   Then evaluations of the structural strength and crashworthiness of each barrier type will be performed.  Following that, recommended guidance and evaluation criteria will be developed to determine when an existing barrier should be upgraded or replaced.</abstract>

    <abstract>Quasi-static experiments were conducted to subject buckling restrained braces (BRBs) to a regime of relative end displacements demands to investigate if the BRBsï¿½ end connections could be able to sustain the required displacement demands when installed in bidirectional ductile end diaphragm systems (EDS). The loading protocols included the bidirectional displacement histories to be applied to the specimens for the cyclic inelastic test and the uniaxial displacement histories for the low-cycle fatigue test caused by temperature changes. Two types of BRBs with flat end plates and unidirectional pinholes, namely BRB-1 and BRB-2, were designed and tested. Four specimens of each type of BRB were tested under combinations of different displacement protocols, and the resulting BRBsï¿½ hysteretic behaviors were studied and compared. All the BRB specimens tested developed cumulative inelastic deformations of more than 200 times the BRBï¿½s axial yield displacement. The specimens were able to sustain multiple years of severe temperature cycles in addition to meeting the seismic qualification test criterion. Ultimately, as expected, all BRBs failed in tension after extensive cycles of inelastic deformations. No undesirable end-plate failure or instability was observed. A recommended design procedure for the EDS with BRBs in both straight and skew bridges was developed based on these experimental results.</abstract>

    <abstract>Today, the railroad industry carries 40% of the United Statesï¿½ total freight ton-miles over 100,000 bridges spanning over 225,000ï¿½km (140,000ï¿½mi) of rail tracks and the demand for railroads will increase by 88% by 2035. Railroads maintain their infrastructure to meet this demand and ensure the ability of the bridges to safely carry trains. However, railroad funds are limited and the allocation of resources for operations of maintenance, repair, and replacement (MRR) must be conducted cost effectively. Railroad managers are interested in new and innovative methods to efficiently quantify the structural performance of their bridges. Total transverse bridge displacements provide objective data about structural integrity, informing the prioritization of MRR operations. Measuring bridge displacement with traditional sensors such as a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is often difficult because of the need for a fixed reference frame. Likewise, modern reference-free and noncontact response measurement approaches require methods that are expensive, technologically complex, or computationally prohibitive for bridge managers. This paper investigates the feasibility of a novel approach for measuring total reference-free transverse displacements of railroad bridges by aggregating data obtained from multiple sensors, where train derailment because of excessive transverse movement is the main concern. The method implements a finite impulse response (FIR) filter to compute drift-free dynamic displacement by using acceleration measurements. Similarly, a moving average (MA) filter extracts the low-frequency content from inclination captured with two accelerometers. The low-frequency inclination is then converted to pseudostatic displacement using Eulerï¿½Bernoulli beam equations. These pseudostatic responses are combined with dynamic displacements derived from accelerometer data, allowing estimatation of the total reference-free transverse displacement in the field. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a cantilever column representing a timber bridge pile was tested in the laboratory using a shake table and excited with a number of displacement measurements taken in the field from a timber railroad bridge. The results were compared to reference displacements captured with an LVDT, demonstrating that total reference-free transverse displacements can be accurately measured. As a conclusion, the proposed approach can be used as a viable tool supporting data-based informed decisions and has the potential to maximize the efficiency of railroad bridge network management systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>The hybrid composite beam (HCB) is an innovative idea that incorporates traditional construction materials (i.e.,ï¿½steel and concrete) with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in an efficient configuration to optimize the beam constituentsï¿½ performance. The HCB is comprised of three main subcomponents: a composite shell, a compression reinforcement, and a tension reinforcement. The shell is comprised of a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) box. The compression reinforcement consists of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) that is pumped into a profiled conduit within the shell. The tension reinforcement consists of galvanized-steel tendons anchored at the compression reinforcement ends. The HCB is a promising technology in bridge applications because it has several advantages over the conventional structural members (e.g.,ï¿½a prolonged lifetime and a lighter weight). This new technology was recently used to construct three bridges in Missouri. This research study performs the first investigation and analysis for an in-service HCB bridge superstructureï¿½s behavior subjected to thermal loads and proposes a thermal design methodology. This investigation is crucial because the thermal stresses, if not accounted for during the design, can significantly affect a bridge superstructureï¿½s durability, which this new HCB technology strives to address. Beam elements from the longest-spanning HCB constructed bridge in Missouri were instrumented with various strain gauges and thermocouples. The constituting elementsï¿½ temperatures and the corresponding induced strains were recorded over 6 months. The proposed algorithm was used to predict the induced strains. A two-step thermostructural finite-element analysis (FEA) was performed to analyze the HCBï¿½s thermal behavior and further evaluate the proposed algorithmï¿½s performance. The results of this study showed that the proposed algorithm was able to predict, with acceptable accuracy, the thermal stresses and strains in a HCB bridge superstructure. Subsequently, this algorithm is recommended as a useful tool for designing and analyzing HCB bridges that are undergoing environmental thermal effects. The current study also presents recommendations for modifying the thermal gradients recommended by AASHTO for the thermal design of reinforced concrete (RC) superstructures to better suit HCB bridges. Finally, the study proposed techniques for increasing the stiffness of a HCB bridge superstructure, while at the same time minimizing the induced thermal stresses under temperature fluctuations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Some floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSOs) possess disconnectable systems to avoid harsh environments. According to a literature survey, the practice is based on perceptions and experiences of operators to judge disconnection; however, this paper offers a rational approach. A life-cycle cost model is proposed to optimise (1) the disconnection criteria and (2) the design of mooring lines under reliability format. Relevant ultimate limit states are considered in association with hull, moorings and green water failure. Effects of future failure costs are considered (downtime, environmental damage, reputation, etc.). Disconnection criteria are then formulated in terms of significant wave height and wind speed limits. Because a permanent mooring system may exhibit excessive resistance, it is possible to reduce the linesï¿½ thickness until the cost is optimised for non-permanent service. Results for an example in the Gulf of Mexico show that important savings can be achieved by implementing the proposed optimisations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Laplace transform-based spectral element method (LTSEM) can avoid some limitations of the conventional Fourier transform-based spectral element method (FTSEM) in handling finite-length structures, such as the wrap effect. In this paper, a damage identification technique based on the LTSEM and strain statistical moment (SSM) is proposed, which is combined with a general genetic algorithm. The dynamic responses of beam structures were first analyzed using the LTSEM and were validated by finite-element analysis results. Then, the strain statistical moment was used as the damage indicator; the damage location and severity for beam structures were numerically identified on the basis of the proposed technique. Finally, an experimental investigation for damage detection on a simply supported steel beam was also implemented. The experimental results verified that the proposed damage identification technique is feasible and has robust antinoise performance.</abstract>

    <abstract>Many probabilistic studies in the field of offshore structures assume that the drift demand distributes lognormally around its median at all the intensity levels. However, this assumption may not be formally validated, and the purpose of this study is to investigate the assumption of lognormal distribution of the drift demand for the fixed offshore platforms, using Andersonï¿½Darling goodness of fit test. The lognormal hypothesis for the drift demand can be investigated at two different regions as: (1) low intensity levels without any collapse case and (2) higher intensity levels with collapse cases. To this end, both the sample median and sample geometric mean are considered as the estimators of lognormal central tendency. The results indicate that the lognormal hypothesise is accepted based on the sample geometric mean at all the intensity levels. Nevertheless, the lognormal hypothesise is rejected at some intensity levels if the sample median is the central estimator.</abstract>

    <abstract>A Very Large Floating Structure (VLFS) is a promising concept for the utilisation of the sea. Currently, VLFSs are classified into two broad categories: the pontoon-type, limited to sheltered water, and the semi-submersible type, for open-ocean. The authors present a new concept, the delta-type, an important feature of which is the formation of a sheltered basin, providing accessibility in most weather conditions. Initiating the development of this concept, they study its hydrodynamic aspects: basin efficiency, motion, comfort and mooring. The authors present a case study, for which they compare the hydrodynamic aspects for four configurations of equal utilisation areas. The agitation in the basin and the motion are solved linearly for regular and irregular seas. A single-point mooring system is designed and solved in the time-domain, considering the second-order slow-drift motion that is critical to the mooring loads. The auhors obtained promising results that justify the next stage of the study ï¿½ structural aspects.</abstract>

    <abstract>Steelï¿½concrete composite structures are widely used in modern buildings and bridges for their great rigidity, light weight, and simple construction. However, the mechanical behaviors of steelï¿½concrete composite structures degrade over time because of environmental corrosion and long-term load. The existing research on structural durability has often focused on concrete or steel structures. Few studies have been conducted on steelï¿½concrete composite structures, especially on structures under the coupled impact of corrosion and load. To investigate the coupled impact of corrosion and load on the performance of steelï¿½concrete composite structures, a long-term test of 200ï¿½days was carried out on eight connectors. The corrosion of the studs was accelerated by DC current, and the test connectors were submerged in a salt solution with a concentration of 5% NaCl. Deformations including the concrete strain and relative slippage between the concrete slab and the steel beam were measured in the long-term test. The experimental results showed that at the end of the long-term test, the deformations induced by shrinkage were about three times larger than those induced by creep for the steelï¿½concrete composite structures. Notably, the stiffness of the connectors degraded substantially with the aggravation of the corrosion of the studs, whereas the concrete strain was only slightly affected by the studsï¿½ corrosion. The measured deformations were also obviously larger than those calculated by the current specifications. As a reference, a suitable formula for the long-term elastic modulus is proposed to enhance the applicability of specifications.</abstract>

    <abstract>An improved response surface method (RSM) is presented for reliability analysis of a tunnel face in broken soft rocks. To fully consider the variation of the slip surface caused by the random variables in the process of reliability analysis, the method uses an implicit performance function, and it is adjustable according to each possible combination of the random variables. The improved RSM and the traditional method, which is based on a deterministic performance function (a fixed slip surface), are compared. In practical projects, random variables are often correlated, and normal distributions are not advisable under some circumstances. To satisfy the practical requirements, the proposed method was extended into the space of nonnormal correlated random variables. Sensitivity analysis was performed by examining different combinations of the coefficient of variation (COV) of random variables. Results show the following: (1) A significant improvement was observed in the reliability analysis using the proposed method, especially when a large uniform force was applied to the tunnel face. (2) Beta distributions are suggested in lieu of normal distributions to exclude the negative values that probably occur as random data. (3) The stability of the tunnel face tended to be underestimated without consideration of negative correlation of random variables. (4) The stability of the tunnel face was more sensitive to the internal friction angle than to the cohesion, and the sensitivity was intensified when the negative correlation was considered. In summary, the improved RSM adequately considers the uncertainties in engineering and leads to a more reliable stability assessment of the tunnel face.</abstract>

    <abstract>Identifying the frequencies of practical bridges can help in understanding the bridge dynamic property. However, the vibration amplitude excited by wind load and traffic load is too small, resulting in a small signal noise ratio, which affects the performance of frequency identification. This paper proposes frequency identification procedures for practical bridges to reduce the influence of noise through higher-order spectrum. First, a higher-order spectrum is introduced. Then, the frequency identification procedures are presented for practical bridges. Finally, the proposed procedures are applied to a practical bridge. A higher-order spectrum can eliminate the influence of Gaussian white noise (GWN) or reduce nonstationary random noise during frequency identification. The advantage of using the higher-order spectrum to identify frequencies is verified by simple artificial signals combined with sinusoidal signals with different frequencies and GWN. The results show that the second-order spectrum obtained by the higher-order spectrum has better frequency identification performance than the tradition spectrum and that the frequencies of the practical bridge can be identified successfully.</abstract>

    <abstract>This article presents dynamic tests of three damage-resistant segmental hollow-core bridge columns with posttensioned unbonded strands. One column was constructed without energy dissipaters, whereas the other two columns included different external energy dissipaters. A reference RC column was also investigated. The cross section of the segmental columns was a hollow-core section composed of an outer glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) shell, an inner steel tube, and concrete shell cast in between the GFRP shell and the steel tube. The columns combine the advantages of accelerated bridge construction and self-centering as a result of rocking with high energy dissipation from the external energy dissipaters. All columns were subjected to a sequence of scaled near-fault pulse-like ground motions. The well-designed hollow-core segmental column sustained no noticeable damage and no residual drift after a sequence of motions up to 250% of the design earthquake, which caused a peak drift ratio of 8.85%. Conversely, the counterpart conventional column suffered severe damage, with rebar fracture and extensive concrete spalling. The accumulated residual drift of the conventional column was 1.5% after the sequence of motions up to 200% of the design earthquake, which caused a peak drift ratio of 4.8%. The energy dissipated by the segmental columns with external energy dissipaters was comparable to that of the conventional RC column along the tests.</abstract>

    <abstract>The steel truss arch is an important structural type for high-speed railway bridges with long spans. The fatigue assessment of rigid hangers under long-term train loads is an important concern. In this study, the Nanjing Dashengguan Bridge, a six-line railway steel arch bridge with three planes of truss arches and the largest span in the world, was taken as a case study. First, a fatigue assessment of one short hanger was carried out based on dynamic strain monitoring data in 2015. The influence of bending behavior, train lane, number of carriages, and train speed on the fatigue performance of the short hanger were investigated. Second, the fatigue damage distribution of full-field hangers induced by a single train was analyzed based on a calibrated finite-element model. The influence of driving direction on the fatigue performance of rigid hangers was discussed. Finally, an engineering approach for fatigue performance assessment of full-field hangers was proposed based on annual train volume. Consequently, it was shown that the bending behavior has considerable influence on the fatigue effects of short hangers. In addition, train lane and driving direction also have a significant influence on the fatigue performance of hangers. The fatigue damage of short hangers in the middle truss arch was the most remarkable, followed by the side truss arch on the downstream side (the Beijingï¿½Shanghai High Speed Railway) and then by the side truss arch on the upstream side (the Shanghaiï¿½Wuhanï¿½Chengdu Railway), which should be paid greater attention to in daily maintenance.</abstract>

    <abstract>Superstructures of highway bridges are load rated regularly as a part of the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS). It is well known that the load-carrying capacity of a superstructure is affected by foundation movements; however, the current load rating framework does not explicitly include these effects. In the current framework, foundation movement could be treated as structural condition change and considered as a permanent load. In this paper, the authors propose an integrated framework for load rating of superstructures and substructures in the presence of continuing foundation movements and geohydraulic hazards. The approach is based on the modification of the load rating equation to include foundation movements and effects of loads other than dead and live loads that can affect the load capacity of a bridge. A methodology for load rating elements loaded in biaxial moment and axial load, commonly experienced by piers, columns, and piles, has also been proposed. The term substructure functionality index (SFI) has been proposed to account for the effect of foundation movement on the functionality of critical elements such as bearings. Applications of the proposed integrated superstructure-substructure load rating and SFI have been demonstrated through two examples of actual bridges. It has been demonstrated that the load rating produced can be nonconservative if the effects of foundation movement are neglected.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study proposes an alternative and competitive methodology for predicting solitary wave forces on coastal bridge decks using artificial neural networks (ANNs). It is imperative to accurately predict the on-deck wave forces for the design and retrofit of coastal bridges subject to the potential impact of hurricanes and tsunamis. For this purpose, ANNs are used to determine wave loads based on a valid data set. First, the structural, fluid, and wave variables involved in the bridge deck-wave interaction are briefly introduced. The back-propagation network (BPN) wave force prediction model trained using the back-propagation algorithm is highlighted. A data set with 472 evidence cases is prepared based on extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Three major input variables, the still-water level (SWL), bottom elevation of the girder/superstructure, and wave height, are selected. Then, the procedures of training the ANNs for the vertical and horizontal forces are presented in detail. Finally, the trained network structures with high predictive skills after substantial training are given with a proposed predictive equation for the vertical and horizontal forces. The results showed that the ANN methodology is robust and capable of capturing the underlying physical complexity in the bridge deck-wave interaction.</abstract>

    <abstract>Different from short-span girder bridges, long-span bridges support a large amount of traffic, which significantly influences the dynamic performance of the bridge. The design live load on long-span bridges has seldom been investigated to take into account the dynamic effects from multiple vehicles in traffic flow. The current AASHTO LRFD specification was primarily developed for and calibrated from bridges with spans of 61.0 m (200 ft) or less. Therefore, it is unknown whether it is risky or conservative to use the same design live load from AASHTO on long-span bridges with spans longer than 100 m. Taking advantage of the advanced simulation methodology on the coupled bridge-traffic system developed recently, the live-load effects on a prototype long-span bridge from stochastic traffic flow were comprehensively studied, including the extreme dynamic response and the dynamic amplification factors for different bridge components. To evaluate the applicability of the design live-load in the current AASHTO specification on long-span bridges, the load effects on the prototype long-span bridge were numerically assessed and were compared with the corresponding response envelopes of the bridge under stochastic traffic flow. It was found that the design live load from AASHTO may be unsafe for use as the live load for the design of the bridge girder, pylon, and stay cables for long-span bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cable-stayed bridges, of which there are up to 500 around the world, are often the first choice for long-span bridges. As stay cables increase in service life, rust becomes the most common challenge. At present, more than 20 cases of replacing corroded cables are underway worldwide. Inspections of replaced cables prove that corrosion is a leading cause of degradation in the mechanical behavior of cables. However, there is no accurate method of describing the law of degradation of the mechanical behavior of corroded cables and it remains impossible to evaluate the safety of stay cables in a timely fashion. Therefore, this paper reports a study on distribution model of steel wire corrosion, corrosion rate, and mechanical model of corroded cables, establishing governing equations for static configuration and in-plane free vibration of corroded cables. The paper also derives some analytical solutions for both the static and dynamic characteristics of corroded cables. The finite element method is adopted for the simulation and computation of the static and dynamic characteristics of corroded cables to reach, through comparison and analysis of the results of the two methods, the following conclusions. As corrosion time increases, the horizontal cable force of the corroded cable decreases nonlinearly, cable sag increases nonlinearly, and natural frequencies in-plane of the corroded cable present nonlinear reduction. In early corrosion stage, relative change of static and dynamic characteristics of cables is extremely small. For a corrosion time of 12&#x2009;years, the average cross section area loss rate in cable corrosion region is 30%, but horizontal cable force is only reduced by 1%, cable sag rises only by 1%, and the decrease of each natural frequency in the plane is only 0.54%.</abstract>

    <abstract>The combination of continued highway bridge aging and constrained maintenance, repair, and replacement budgets create the pressing need to develop strategies to allocate available management resources most effectively. Strategies for preventative maintenance scheduling and budget projection greatly depend on the ability to predict bridge deterioration. Mechanistic deterioration models, which analyze the physical processes causing deterioration, have the potential to supplement purely statistical deterioration models and to address limitations associated with bridge inspection data and statistical methods. A variety of mechanistic models that consider specific aspects of deterioration processes is available in the literature. This study considered how existing mechanistic models for predicting corrosion-induced cracking of RC bridge decks can be assembled into a comprehensive model that can predict the complete deck service life and be used to propose preventative maintenance schemes for the decks. The construction practices of modern RC bridge decks were investigated and an attempt was made to assemble a mechanistic model, including the effects of epoxy-coated rebar, waterproofing membranes, asphalt overlays, joint deterioration, and deck maintenance. In some cases, new temporary models had to be proposed to fill gaps in existing modeling capabilities. After a complete model was assembled, Monte Carlo simulation with probabilistic model inputs was applied to simulate the inherent randomness associated with deterioration. The results of this effort indicated that mechanistic models are, indeed, promising, and well-timed preventative maintenance may provide longer bridge deck service life with fewer total maintenance actions than current methods do. However, experimental studies of specific deterioration processes and additional bridge data collection are needed to supplement existing models and validate model predictions.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge vortex-induced vibration (VIV) involves a number of uncertainties resulting from wind characteristics, structural properties, and bluff-body aerodynamics. Evaluation of VIV considering the variability in the parameter space has been of great concern. In this study, the influence of various parameters related to windï¿½bridge interactions on the VIV was evaluated based on different reliability calculation approaches. Specifically, the random nature in the parameter space, which was obtained based on the available data from both laboratories and meteorological stations, was propagated to assess its influence on the structural VIV utilizing the second-order second-moment (SOSM), second-order fourth-moment (SOFM), and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods. Three VIV performance functions involving different considerations of vibration-amplitude models and lock-in wind speeds were constructed. A long-span arch bridge was selected as an example to compute the failure probabilities of VIV considering parametric uncertainties and various performance functions.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this study, an adjustment factor was developed to better estimate the shear capacity of simple span prestressed concrete (PC) girders, for intended use in load rating. The adjustment factor is expressed as a function of several critical girder parameters including concrete strength, prestress level, stirrup spacing, and girder height. The adjustment factor was determined from a regression analysis of over 200 shear capacity results. The database was obtained from a parametric analysis conducted with a finite-element model validated with experimental data. Three different code methods were considered for comparison. Generally, code results were found to be inconsistently conservative. Application of the adjustment factor to an established procedure produced improvement in the accuracy and consistency of shear capacity estimation over existing code methods for the range of girder parameters considered. In addition, potential effects on rating factors for inventory and operational levels were quantified.</abstract>

    <abstract>Although the use of segmental bridge decks has increased around the world, their use in seismic regions under vertical earthquake motions is yet to be fully understood. The asymmetric behavior of segment joints under vertical motions as well as the low strain ductility of cables passing through the joints raise questions on postearthquake performance of decks following a disastrous earthquake and during aftershocks. Because strong aftershocks can expedite the collapse of structures damaged in the mainshock, assessing the residual capacity of mainshock-damaged bridges becomes important with regard to postearthquake performance. In the current research, two medium- and long-span case study bridges were investigated to study the residual capacity of bridges of such type. To this end, a two-dimensional model for segment joints was developed and verified via experimental results. The results related to nonlinear time-history analysis under the design earthquakes showed that midspan segment joints were bound to suffer spalling concretes at the bottom and yielding tendons at the top. The findings revealed that the residual capacity of the mainshock-damaged bridges decreases with the increase in the damage level caused by mainshock, yet not more than 50% in comparison to the intact bridge, even at the worst damage level.</abstract>

    <abstract>As the number of deteriorated infrastructure assets, including culverts, continues to rise, there is a need to find the most cost-effective approaches to dealing with these assets. At the same time, there is a growing awareness that decisions cannot be made exclusively based on cost and that sustainability must also be considered. Although there exist a number of tools that allow environmental, societal, economic, and technical considerations to be assessed when evaluating alternatives for many infrastructure projects, there is no such tool for culverts. This paper describes the development of a culvert module for a commercially available assessment tool known as GoldSET. The environmental, societal, economic, and technical indicators used within the culvert module are introduced and described. The use of the tool is then demonstrated using two case studies that assess the viability of a traditional open-cut approach compared to trenchless approaches. For the two selected case studies, the trenchless approaches are found to be preferable except if considerations of technical uncertainties dominate the decision making.</abstract>

    <abstract>Underground freight transportation (UFT) is a class of automated transportation systems in which vehicles carry freight through tunnels or pipelines under roadways between intermodal terminals. The UFT systems increase the current freight movement capacity and alleviate the problems associated with the fast growing need for freight transportation. Despite the inherent UFT benefits to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance safety and security of freight transportation while improving sustainability, a detailed lifecycle benefit-cost analysis is yet required to explicitly show planners and decision makers the economic feasibility of such systems. The primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive lifecycle benefit-cost analysis of linear induction motor-based UFT systems for five different scenarios. This methodology includes the following steps: (1)ï¿½developing UFT scenarios with different sizes (small, medium, and large) and routes (short and long) in collaboration with a stakeholder committee; (2)ï¿½determining lifecycle cash flows; (3)ï¿½calculating net present values, benefit-cost ratios, and internal rates of returns; (4)ï¿½conducting sensitivity analysis; and (5)ï¿½performing breakeven analysis. The results of this research show that the highest benefits of the UFT systems are revenue from shipment and reduction in air pollution. The internal rates of return, benefit-cost ratios, and net present values of the UFT scenarios indicate that the benefits offset the costs of the system. Results of sensitivity analysis show that the economic feasibility of the large and medium-size UFTs is more sensitive to tunnel construction cost and revenue from shipments. They also indicate that the economic feasibility of the UFT system with a short route and small size is more sensitive to higher discount rates and the policies concerning the shipment pricing. Results of breakeven analysis highlight a shorter payback period for the large and medium-size UFTs compared with small-size scenarios. The results show that the price of shipment for all the UFT scenarios is highly competitive compared with the current price of shipment by trucks.</abstract>

    <abstract>To investigate the characteristics of wind fields at the bridge site in mountain-gorge terrains more accurately and rationally, an updated curved boundary transition section (BTS) was proposed in this study. The flow transition efficiency considering the updated curved BTS was first investigated and compared with those in previous studies. Then a mountain-gorge terrain model in which a long-span bridge straddles was configured as a typical numerical example by establishing two different BTSs in the computational domain for comparison purpose. Furthermore, the effects of different BTSs on the characteristics of wind fields at the bridge site with two different ranges of terrain region were comparably investigated. The results show that the updated curved BTS is very user-friendly with a straightforward expression and has a better flow transition efficiency than those reported previously. The wind speeds at the bridge site with the updated curved BTS outperform those with the ramp BTS. An appropriate shape of BTS can probably be more important than the size factor of the terrain region in terms of predicating the characteristics of wind fields at the bridge site in such mountain-gorge terrains. It is hoped that this updated curved BTS can serve as basics for analyzing the wind fields at the bridge site in mountain-gorge terrains, which will be of benefit to investigate the structure performance under wind loads not only in the design stage but also in the service stage.</abstract>

    <abstract>There are over 80,000 culverts under Ohio's roadways that the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is responsible for maintenance. An essential component of culvert management is periodic inspection.  Traditionally, highway agencies relied mainly on direct man-entry approach for assessing in-service conditions of culverts. However, this traditional approach left many drainage structures inapproachable and uninspected. This is because a large number of drainage structures in the state are either too small (diameter or rise less than 4 ft) or obstructed (filled with water or sediment) for man-entry.   The number of culverts in ODOT's database is increasing in each year with new culverts being added due to new bypass highway constructions and ever increasing culvert replacement projects. Every time a new culvert is placed, it must be inspected right after installation (post-construction inspection) and periodically thereafter per ODOT requirement. ODOT has Construction &amp; Materials Specifications (CMS) Item 611.12 that dictates how the post-construction culvert inspection must be conducted in Ohio.

    The main goal of the proposed study is to identify remote culvert inspection technologies which are cost effective, easy and safe to operate, capable of performing post-installation inspection (according to the ODOT Item 611.12), capable of measuring deflections, capable of measuring crack sizes, and capable of providing enough data to allow an accurate culvert rating. 

    This research will be conducted in two phases. The proposed Phase 1 study will identify remote culvert inspection technologies that can be utilized safely to inspect and rate culverts in Ohio,   Phase 2 will test the technologies identified in Phase 1 and is contingent upon the successful completion of Phase 1 and the written authorization of the ODOT Research Section.   </abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, a continuum model is proposed for static and dynamic analyses of a three-span suspension bridge with three-dimensionally curved main cables. To obtain equations of motion for this model, coupled differential equations are derived for vertical displacements of a main cable and a girder as well as lateral displacements of a main cable subjected to external loads. A compatibility equation of a three-dimensionally curved cable is also derived. Utilizing the Galerkin method, the equations of motion are obtained in matrix form. A case study bridge is used to verify the continuum model against a finite element model. Verification results show that, for distributed static loads on the girder and temperature changes in the main cable and the hangers and for dynamic moving loads on the girder, the continuum model can accurately determine static and dynamic responses, namely displacements, velocities, accelerations, bending moments, and shear forces of the girder and additional horizontal forces in the main cable.</abstract>

    <abstract>Adequate design of composite bridge girders requires accurate determination of stud capacities and demands that develop during force transfer at the steelï¿½concrete interface. This paper focuses on residual stud fatigue capacities and accumulated stud damage in existing bridge girders, following decades of high traffic loading. The paper includes discussion from non-destructive magnetic-particle inspection (MPI) and dye-penetrant testing (DPT) crack investigations on the studs of two existing bridge girders following deck removal. In addition, three destructive fatigue push-out tests are performed on the flanges of an existing high-traffic bridge girder to help understand stud residual fatigue capacity. Historic traffic count data are combined with these destructive and non-destructive tests to provide insight into accumulated bridge damage during many years of traffic loading, and to provide insight into potential conservancies in the current AASHTO stud design provisions. Results from the non-destructive MPI and DPT investigations indicated no detectable fatigue cracks within the studs of the two bridge girders (which were estimated to have seen over 25,000,000 and 38,000,000 truck cycles respectively). Results from all three fatigue tests exceeded the AASHTO design life expectancy of approximately 850,000 cycles (at 11.6 ksi (80 MPa)) by over 2.5 million cycles. This residual fatigue life is over 400% of the expected shear stud fatigue life, even after over 38,000,000 truck cycles estimated during the in-service life of the bridge. The excellent shear stud fatigue performance observed is likely due to additional shear transfer through adhesion and or friction between the concrete deck and steel flange during service loading, which are not considered in the current AASHTO design calculations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Although the residual shear strength of ASR-damaged slab bridges without shear reinforcement has been discussed for several decades, the amount of published research on this topic is very limited. This paper presents the results of a test series on 18 reinforced beams sawn from a severely ASR-damaged flat slab bridge. Flexural failure as well as shear failure were observed. The test results indicate that the ASR cracks in the beams strongly influenced the propagation of load-induced cracks. Generally, the calculated moment capacity of beams tested in three-point bending was lower than the maximum moment carried by the beams. For the beams tested in asymmetric four-point bending, an increase in the shear span-to-effective depth ratio resulted in a decrease in the measured shear strength. The measured shear strengths were compared with calculated shear strengths using the Eurocode 2. Calculations based on the compressive strength of drilled cores were rather conservative at low shear span-to-effective depth ratios. However, the conservatism of the Eurocode 2 decreased with increasing shear span-to-effective depth ratios. With the inclusion of ASR-induced pre-stress effect, the calculated shear strengths correlated better with the measured shear strengths. The test results indicated that the ASR-induced pre-stress effect can, to some extent, compensate for the significant loss in material properties.</abstract>

    <abstract>A reinforced concrete half-joint bridge consists of suspended span dapped-end beams or a full-width deck supported on the nibs of abutments or adjacent beams. The design of their disturbed regions is traditionally performed by means of strut-and-tie modelling. The design provisions found in standards and codes can be used for the assessment of existing structures with minor adjustments. However, current documents provide limited guidance on the incorporation of deterioration aspects such as corrosion, insufficient anchorage lengths, and crack formation. Experiments performed on 12 half-joint beams demonstrated the effects of single defects, but synergistic effects were also found to exist and might lead to much higher reductions than expected from the sum of individual defects. These results were compared to different strut-and-tie models (STMs) and the application of STMs to achieve the highest lower bound estimate of the load carrying capacity is discussed. For the beams studied in the current work, the predictions based on codes and standards, combined with appropriate methods to incorporate deterioration effects, led to safe load bearing capacity estimates. However, the developed STMs seem to be, in some instances, unable to pick up alternative load paths that develop as soon as the capacity of a certain tie is reached. Hence the actual capacities might be higher than what is obtained from the STM calculations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The overall objective of the Phase I research was to develop and characterize economical non-proprietary UHPC mixes made with materials readily available in Montana. This objective was achieved by first identifying and obtaining suitable/economical materials to be used in UHPC. Specifically, the materials identified and used in this research were simply Type I/II portland cement (from Trident, MT), class F fly ash (from North Dakota), fine masonry sand (from Billings, MT), silica fume, and high range water reducer. UHPC mixes were then developed/characterized/optimized using a statistical experimental design procedure (response surface methodology). The mixes developed as part of this research obtained compressive strengths of approximately 20 ksi with flows of 9-11 inches, and cost approximately $800 per cubic yard with steel fibers (proprietary mixes cost in the range of $2500-$3500). The mechanical and durability properties of these mixes are currently being evaluated. It should be noted that in the Phase I research, the concrete trial batches produced were 0.2 to 1.5 cubic feet in size, and were mixed using equipment available in the MSU concrete lab (i.e., a Hobart industrial cake mixer, and a mortar mixer). This research and previous research on UHPC has shown that batch size, mixing equipment, mixing method, and mixing energy can have a significant effect on the performance of the resulting UHPC mix. Therefore, further research should be conducted on the proposed UHPC mixes using the equipment that will be used in the field (most likely a high-shear mixer), under various mixing conditions (e.g., various temperatures, various aggregate moisture contents), and in larger batch sizes. Previous research on UHPC field cast joints has shown that UHPC can reduce development lengths of the reinforcing in the inter-element connection zone, and thus reduce spacing between decks. However, this research was conducted using only proprietary UHPC concrete mixes. Further research should be conducted on field cast joints using the newly developed non-proprietary mixes to ensure that these mixes behave as expected in this application (e.g., increased bond strength, decreased deck spacing).</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge deck deterioration is a frequent problem faced by many states in the U.S., especially the Midwest and Northern states where deicing is used and Coastal states. Maintenance and repair associated with bridge decks can cost 50 to 80% of all bridge related expenditures, which is conservatively estimated to be more than $5B per year (Gucunski et al. 2011). Using bridges from Iowa, Gucunski et al. demonstrated typical bridge deck deterioration's include cracking, spalling, delamination, and corrosion of reinforcement (Fig. 1 ). Various phenomena contribute to deck deterioration, including poor initial quality, the use of deicing salts in winter, overloading, stresses associated with freeze-thaw cycles, fatigue, corrosion of reinforcement, or any combination thereof. Near the coast, the bridge decks can experience damage due to seawater salt. Several of these problems initiate due to surface cracking and infiltration of moisture and chloride into the deck.  A variety of techniques have been used to repair damaged bridge decks. They can range from grouting to seal surface cracks to partial/full depth patching to replacing partial/full bridge deck. While each of these techniques can increase the service life of the bridge decks, none has been proven to completely prevent further bridge deck deterioration nor do they increase the longevity of bridge decks.  With its superior durability properties, the use of ultra-high performance concrete with fiber reinforcement (UHPC) in bridge deck has been explored in Iowa as a means to combat wide-ranging bridge deck deterioration problems. Given that solid UHPC slab deck is prohibitively expensive, use of a waffle deck was successfully demonstrated (Aaleti et al. 2013; Aaleti and Sritharan 2014). By optimizing the waffle deck configuration, it was shown that the waffle deck concept can be used to reduce the volume of the required UHPC in bridge decks by 50% or more in comparison to solid bridge deck panels (Gheitanbaf et al. 2015). To further reduce the construction cost and broaden the application of UHPC in bridge decks, use of a thin UHPC layer as an overlay was then explored with an intention of preventing deck cracking, reducing fatigue damage and minimizing penetration of moisture and chloride ion into the bridge deck. To ensure cost effectiveness of this concept, the thickness of UHPC layer was targeted to be about 1.5 in. with no mechanical connection between the UHPC layer and underlying normal concrete (NC) deck. This approach will reduce the required volume of UHPC in bridge deck to less than 20% when compared to a solid panel.</abstract>

    <abstract>The high amount of confining lateral steel required by seismic design provisions for rectangular bridge columns can cause steel congestion which may hinder the placement of conventional concrete (CC). Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) eliminates or reduces concrete placement and consolidation issues; however, there is limited data on the seismic performance of SCC bridge columns. This study encompassed experimental investigations to assess the stress-strain relationships of SCC mixes and the seismic performance of rectangular SCC bridge columns. SCC and CC rectangular columns were tested. Experimental results showed that the strain at strength and the ultimate strain of SCC are higher than those of CC, while concrete ductility and the elastic modulus of SCC are lower than those of CC. Experimental results of the column tests showed that the use of SCC reduces displacement ductility and energy dissipation but increases drift ratio at failure. The SCC column performance under inelastic cyclic lateral loading was found to be satisfactory and comparable to that of CC columns.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a strategy to optimize the cable system of multi-span cable-stayed bridges with crossing stay cables. A general approach to minimize the steel volume in cables is performed considering number of cables, cable anchor positions on the deck, cable area and prestressing forces as design variables. Each cable anchor position is associated to an independent design variable allowing overlapping stay cables as well as different spacing along the deck. As the number of cables can vary throughout the bridge, the final design could have different number of cables on each side of the same tower. The possibility of designing a non-conventional cable arrangement leads to significant reductions in cable steel while satisfying structural design constraints. The Queensferry Crossing (UK) was chosen as a real application example to verify the capabilities of the proposed methodology.</abstract>

    <abstract>Full-depth precast concrete deck systems have been increasingly used in bridge construction due to their high production quality, reduced construction duration, possible weight reduction, and lower life-cycle cost. Precast concrete deck systems are usually made composite with the supporting girders to enhance the structural performance and reduce superstructure depth. Most of the composite systems use clustered shear connectors at large spacing to reduce the number of field-cast connections and simplify production and erection operations. Current prediction models of interface shear resistance were developed for continuous shear connectors in cast-in-place concrete deck systems. This paper investigates the applicability of the existing interface shear prediction models to clustered shear connectors. Sixteen full-scale push-off specimens with clustered shear connectors on concrete and steel girders were tested. Also, the results of 162 push-off experiments obtained from the literature were used to compare the prediction models adopted by AASHTO LRFD, fib MC, Eurocode-2, and CSA-S6 bridge design codes. Comparisons indicated that all design codes provide conservative estimates for interface shear resistance of clustered shear connectors. Parameters affecting the interface shear resistance of clustered shear connectors were also identified.</abstract>

    <abstract>External posttensioning is a useful technique both for strengthening damaged beams, and for the construction of new girder bridges. In an externally posttensioned member, the prestressing tendons are located outside the cross section and connected to the structure by anchorages and deviators, that are the only points where compatibility occurs (at least in the direction orthogonal to the beam axis). This fact implies that a simply supported, externally prestressed beam is a redundant structure. Two numerical methods able to describe the time evolution of both the stress distribution and the displacements of a simply supported concrete beam externally prestressed are introduced and discussed. The distinction between them lies in the way they solve the Volterra integral that is involved in the solving system: one of them performs a numerical solution (almost exact) of this integral whereas the second one adopts an approximate solution. The example presented makes it possible to verify the precision of the approximate method when compared to the almost exact one.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this report is to determine the most effective method for bridge deck overlay construction and repair by assessing current practices; examining new products and technologies; and reviewing NCHRP (National Cooperative Highway Research Program) guidelines, state standard specifications, ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) infrastructure ratings, and original bridge core chloride penetration data. Based on the review, this report offers the following conclusions. Latex modified concrete (LMC) overlays perform well, provide a long service life, and are the most commonly used method of bridge deck rehabilitation. Ohio considers microsilica concrete (MSC) overlays as state of the art due to their lower permeability. Superplasticized dense concrete (SDC), fly-ash modified concrete (FAMC), and polymer modified concrete (PMC) are other acceptable choices for bridge deck overlays. Silane or epoxy sealers may be used as a low-cost preventative approach to slow the deterioration of concrete bridge decks. Waterproofing membranes have produced mixed results but have the potential to be an effective system if installed correctly. Rosphaltï¿½ can be an expensive material but offers benefits such as minimizing traffic disruption due to shorter installation periods and increased durability. The two most important conclusions drawn from this research are the importance of a comprehensive approach when selecting a bridge deck rehabilitation method, and the importance of properly following instructions when installing overlays or waterproofing membrane systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study conducts shake table studies and analysis of a large-scale novel posttensioned (PT) precast bridge column connected to a precast footing with a pocket connection. The primary objective is to develop a resilient square precast bridge column with minimal residual lateral displacement and plastic hinge damage when subjected to strong earthquakes. Another objective is to evaluate a column-footing pocket connection. The column is posttensioned with unbonded carbon fiberï¿½reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons to eliminate permanent drifts. To mitigate seismic damage, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is used in the plastic hinge zone of the column. The column model is subjected to the 1994 Northridge-Rinaldi earthquake record with increasing amplitudes until failure. Experimental results show that the drift ratio and displacement ductility capacity of the column are 6.9 and 13.8%, respectively, and the residual displacement is negligible. Furthermore, the pocket connection is effective in forming the plastic hinge in the column with no connection damage. Another finding of the study is that available fiber element models lead to close correlation between the measured and calculated responses.</abstract>

    <abstract>Dynamic load testing has become a common practice for condition assessment of masonry arch bridges and lays the foundation for their rehabilitation procedures; however, additional dynamic testing after rehabilitation is rare. Carrying out dynamic load tests before and after rehabilitation programs produces valuable results with regard to the structural changes of the bridge. This paper tries to assess the effects of ballast cleaning on the performance of railway masonry arch bridges by conducting dynamic load tests before and after the rehabilitation procedure. To do so, a 70-year-old masonry arch bridge is instrumented with deflection meters and accelerometers. Dynamic load tests are carried out before and after ballast cleaning and results are compared. According to the test results, vertical deflections of different spots on the bridge remain the same, with a deviation of less than 5%. On the other hand, vibrations on the structure are reduced significantly. On average, vibration levels are reduced by 35% in different spots of the structure.</abstract>

    <abstract>The study aims to mitigate the impact of structure-borne noise from existing elevated railway bridges on residents living along the line. In the study, a viscoelastic waveguide absorber mounted on a track slab was proposed based on waveguide vibration absorption techniques by proceeding from the vibration transmitting path and using the track slab as the carrier. First, a dynamic model for the slab-mounted viscoelastic waveguide absorber was constructed, in which a vibration equation was derived and an energy consumption mechanism was obtained. Then, a Chinese railway track style II (CRTS II) ballastless track slab most widely used in Chinese elevated railways was modelled as the primary vibration system, on which an experimental modal analysis was performed. Additionally, a parameterized analysis was performed on the dynamic performance of the slab-mounted viscoelastic waveguide absorber based on the vibration absorption and energy consumption mechanism of the absorber to determine the optimum parameter configuration for the dissipater. Furthermore, the most suitable installation positions for the energy waveguide links were defined using a response surface method. Finally, a bridge vibration response control effectiveness under train loads was also investigated, and it indicated that the waveguide absorbers had a favourable effect in reducing the vibration and structure-borne noise from the elevated railway bridge.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge dynamics and aerodynamics have been in many cases overlooked in the design stages and consequent low behaviour performance and safety margin have been not rarely observed and detected by means of structural monitoring of the bridge soon after it is brought into full service. In this paper, a selection of important issues regarding design and practical requirements for a high structural performance of main components of conventional and cable-stayed bridges are pointed out and discussed briefly. The paper encompasses sections describing some relevant aspects regarding the numerical and physical modelling of the structural system and the mathematical modelling of the dynamic and aerodynamic loads. Special attention is given to the dynamic interaction between vehicles and structures of roadways and railway bridges and also to the aeroelastic analyses of bridges&#x2032; behaviour and their consequent implications on the structural performance of a bridge during its service life. Case examples of actual bridges subjected to dynamic forces produced by the traffic of heavy vehicles and by the wind action are explored to depict the main sources of problems which in some cases caused structural misbehaviour. Some practical measures to improve the behaviour and performance of bridge structures are outlined.</abstract>

    <abstract>The accuracy of bridge system safety evaluations and reliability assessments obtained through refined structural and finite element analyses depends not only on the accuracy of the structural model itself but also on the proper modelling of the maximum traffic loads. While current code-specified live load models were calibrated to properly reflect the safety levels of bridge structures analysed using the simplified methods adopted in bridge design and evaluation manuals, these load models may not lead to accurate results when implemented during refined structural analysis procedures. This paper describes a method to calibrate appropriate live load models that can be used for advanced analyses of bridges. The calibration procedure is demonstrated using actual traffic data collected at a representative weigh-in-motion station in New York State. The proposed calibration methodology is applicable for developing live load models for different bridge service periods, bridge types and design/assessment codes or standards. Live load models obtained using the proposed calibration procedure are readily implementable for deterministic refined analyses of highway bridges to produce similar results to those of complex traffic load simulations. Examples are presented that describe how results of such calibrated live load models would be used in engineering practice.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Serbian road network includes a large portion of bridges with shallow foundations vulnerable to local scour as tragically demonstrated during the extreme flooding in May 2014. Currently, the bridge management procedures in Serbia and worldwide do not comprehensively account for a risk of bridge failure due to flooding and fail to provide sufficient information for the decision-making. Thus, a novel methodology for quantitative vulnerability assessment is suggested as a tool to identify the most vulnerable bridges in a network. Herein, the essential task is evaluation of the conditional probability of a bridge failure due to local scour in a flooding event of a certain magnitude. To apply this approach on a network level, there is a dire need to establish precise practice-ready guidelines on an optimal set of information to be used and/or collected in situ, which is discussed on an example of the Serbian bridge database. The vulnerability of a bridge to local scour may be used as a comprehensive indicator of a bridge performance in a flooding event. For a network level, the vulnerability maps with respect to flooding of different magnitudes will give road operators crucial information to apply adequate quality control plans to vulnerable bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper aims at stressing the major role that Dynamic Identification and Continuous Dynamic Monitoring can play in the observation and understanding of the structural behaviour of bridges along the different phases of their life cycle, based on the authorsï¿½ experience got at the Laboratory of Vibrations and Structural Monitoring (ViBest) of the University of Porto during the last 20 years. The paper comprehends two initial sections summarising some relevant aspects regarding the evolution observed in terms of excitation devices and instrumentation, as well as in the field of modal identification of large Civil structures. Subsequently, the importance of dynamic identification along bridgesï¿½ life cycle (design, construction, commissioning, and service or rehabilitation phases) is illustrated on the basis of relevant case studies, involving several outstanding structures. Lastly, the interest and potential of Continuous Dynamic Monitoring is also emphasised, describing several dynamic monitoring programmes implemented with different perspectives, such as: (i) the vibration serviceability safety checking in lively footbridges; (ii) the evaluation of dynamic effects of traffic loads in roadway and railway bridges and fatigue assessment; (iii) the vibration based damage detection; (iv) or the dynamic monitoring of wind effects on large bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper deals with accuracy and long-term stability of bridge weigh-in-motion (B-WIM) systems. Research focused on four improvements, developed within two research projects financed by the European Commission. These improvements have increased accuracy of the results for four classes according to the European WIM specifications. The novel axle detection method recommends alternative locations to acquire strain responses under the moving vehicles, which provide reliable axle information without the need to install axle detectors in the carriageway. The new algorithm for calculating experimental influence lines combines the individual influence lines, generated from the responses of vehicles from the traffic flow, to obtain a robust solution that does not depend on the type of the vehicle. The third development adjusts the sensor factors to account for measurement errors on concrete structures, especially those resulted from hidden cracks. Finally, the effects of varying temperature and vehicle velocities on the WIM results were studied and their influences mitigated, to increase long-term stability of B-WIM results. All improvements were validated using long-term B-WIM measurements collected on four different bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study presents the general features of the structural health monitoring (SHM) system of the long-span cable-supported bridges in Turkey, namely the First Bosphorus Bridge, the Second Bosphorus Bridge (Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge), the newly constructed the Third Bosphorus Bridge (Yavuz Sultan Selim) and the Osman Gazi Bridge (Izmit Bay Bridge). Due to the critical function of the bridges in the transportation networks of Istanbul, structural health under extreme and operational load cases without interruption of their operation is essential. The SHM systems are already available and in use for the First and Second Bosphorus Bridges; however, the Yavuz Sultan Selim and the Osman Gazi Bridges, only have the preliminary SHM systems established. General preferences of the current and planned SHM systems of the bridges are given based on the monitoring objectives and requirements. Data collected from the SHM systems are also exhibited as an illustration for structural modal identification of the First Bosphorus Bridge. Based on the experiences from the current SHM systems, future works and planning are recommended to effectively design new SHM system and to efficiently update the current ones.</abstract>

    <abstract>Field-cast cementitious grouts are commonly used for connecting adjacent prefabricated bridge deck elements. These grouts can exhibit high shrinkage levels and are susceptible to premature bond failure at the interface between the precast concrete and connection grout. These actions commonly result in connection cracking, which can lead to serviceability issues in the bridge structure such as reinforcing bar corrosion, leakage, and degradation of structural performance. This study presents a set of potential strategies to enhance the shrinkage properties and bond performance of these grouted connections. The strategies include using advanced materials such as ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), proper detailing of precast concrete connection surfaces, application of internal curing in connection grouts, and use of interface premoistening. The study includes experiments conducted at both material and component levels. At the material level, these potential improvement strategies were evaluated using standardized shrinkage and bond-strength test methods. To demonstrate the impact on structural performance, some of these strategies were used in a component-level investigation consisting of three large-scale bridge deck connection tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested strategies can reduce shrinkage, enhance bond strength, and improve structural performance of connections.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper analyses peak ice loads on an inclined, rigid marine structure by using data from 2D combined finite-discrete element method simulations. The aim is look for answers to the questions: what type of distributions do peak ice loads follow, what type of data is needed for their analysis, and how should the data on peak ice loads be collected? In the simulations, an initially continuous ice sheet, modeled as a floating beam, breaks into smaller ice blocks as the sheet is pushed against the structure. Statistical tools were used to analyse the peak ice load distributions, error estimates, and peak ice load occurrences. Load distributions appeared to be right-skewed and thus non-normal. Gumbel distribution appeared to describe the data well. The results show that the large scatter in the ice load data is due to the ice-structure interaction process itself. Due to the scatter, a large number of observations are needed for studying peak ice load statistics: To reliably observe a 15% difference in peak loads due to a single parameter would require more than 80 observations in total. The results showed that high peak loads may occur even in the early stage of the ice-structure interaction process.</abstract>

    <abstract>Recommendations for design of pretensioned bent caps are developed based on the findings of full-scale experimental tests of bent cap subassemblages. Companion examples are provided to demonstrate implementation of the design recommendations. First, recommendations are made for converting existing reinforced concrete bent cap designs to pretensioned designs, providing contractors the option to choose pretensioned caps at any point during the construction process. Next, design recommendations are made for the design of pretensioned caps as part of the original substructure design. Flexural design is based on the concept of zero tension under dead load to ensure that any cracks that form close upon removal of live load. Shear design recommendations modify the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials sectional design method to ensure that crack angles used are physically admissible. New design recommendations are first demonstrated through examples for standard bridge designs. Additional examples demonstrate use of internal voids to reduce weight and how pretensioned bent caps can be used to eliminate column lines to save construction time and cost. Finally, recommendations and examples are included for end region detailing and for incorporation of a pocket connection that minimizes the effects of prestressing and provides considerable tolerance for construction.</abstract>

    <abstract>Precast prestressed concrete bent caps may provide significant benefits by enabling accelerated construction of bridge substructures and improve longevity by reducing the propensity for cracking. The Texas Department of Transportation enables the use of precast reinforced concrete (RC) bent caps through standard connection details that allow contractors the option of cast-in-place or precast caps. A largely unrealized benefit of precast caps is the use of prestressing to enable additional fabrication options and to reduce or eliminate cracking. To enable widespread use, the design and behavior of pretensioned bent caps is explored through a comprehensive study consisting of a literature review, a design study, experimental tests, and with a discussion of the results. Design for flexure is based upon the concept of zero tensile stresses under dead loads, thereby ensuring any cracks close upon removal of live loads. A modified pocket connection is designed to improve constructability and minimize the potential negative effects of prestressing at the reduced cross-section. Full-scale bent caps were tested under indeterminate loads representative of those in multicolumn bents. An RC specimen was designed, constructed, and tested to serve as a performance baseline. Pretensioned caps investigate the spacing of shear spacing, use of voids, and void detailing. Pretensioned caps exhibit significantly reduced flexure cracking, with the ability to fully close upon removal of live load. Bent caps with voids were susceptible to minor shear cracking under design loads, with minimal impact of void detailing. Pocket connections provided adequate performance under design loads. The experimental findings validate the design and construction concepts, which may be useful in developing design and construction recommendations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Federal Highway Administrationï¿½s (FHWAï¿½s) Office of Corporate Research, Technology, and Innovation Management and the Office of Infrastructure Research and Development selected the Geosynthetic Reinforced Soilï¿½Integrated Bridge System (GRS-IBS) program for evaluation. The evaluators were asked to focus on research topic selection, early research development, and deployersï¿½ decisions to adopt GRS-IBS. The study found that FHWA activities, including Every Day Counts, increased awareness of GRS-IBS among potential deployers. GRS-IBS research and deployment were challenged within FHWA by five internal barriers: poor communication, insufficient collaboration, gaps in evidence, dissemination issues, and resistance to change. GRSIBS research and deployment were challenged outside FHWA by four external barriers: knowledge, financial, design, and political. GRS-IBS expresses some of the characteristics of a disruptive technology.</abstract>

    <abstract>The storm surge and waves generated by Hurricane Katrina caused widespread damage to built infrastructure in coastal Mississippi and neighboring states. A number of coastal bridges and roadways failed during this event. One such bridge in coastal Mississippi was the Henderson Point connector that carries US HWY 90 over railroad tracks and a small tidal creek. One two-lane span was completely displaced from its bent beams while the adjacent span shifted laterally by a few inches. The causes of the failure were not known before this study began. This particular site was chosen for the pilot project in order to address a key knowledge gap regarding the vulnerability of coastal bridges: the approach embankment and approach spans that pass through critical elevations where damage during extreme storms is likely. This green infrastructure pilot project seeks to develop a solution that addresses this vulnerability while increasing the resilience of the built and natural systems.  Multiple hydrodynamic models were used to determine the likely causes of failure at the Henderson Point bridge. A number of conventional gray adaptation solutions and green infrastructure adaptation options were considered in this study. A pair of vegetated berms were selected for evaluation as a green infrastructure solution (Figure ES 1). The berms would eliminate or substantially reduce flow velocities near the bridge abutment and low-elevation approach spans by redirecting flood flows away from those vulnerable elements. Even with a relatively low material cost (~$20,000 not including vegetation), the vegetated berms would reduce the likelihood of bridge span failure during its 50-yr design life from 64% to 39%, by protecting the bridge against the 1%annual chance coastal flood event (current protection level is to the 2% event).  There were three significant lessons learned in this pilot project. First, this may be the first known coastal bridge that failed as a result of hydrodynamic drag forces due to flowing water during a hurricane. Second, the application of multiple hydrodynamic models at varying spatial scales delivers superior information about damaging coastal hazards near a transportation asset. Third, there may be similar opportunities to improve the resilience of low-elevation bridge spans to similar types of damage in future storm events. For low-elevation bridge spans over land, extending the embankment to higher elevations, or using something similar to the vegetated berms considered here, could potentially reduce their vulnerability to extreme events now and in the future.</abstract>

    <abstract>The performance of bridges prone to tsunami hazards is critical to the resilience of coastal communities. An important component of resilience is the development of design guidelines, which requires simulating the hydrodynamic loads imparted on bridges by tsunami waves. To support such simulation efforts, data collected from wave flume experiments were used to validate the particle finite-element method (PFEM) implementation in OpenSees, which has been widely used for earthquake engineering simulation of bridges. The numerical results agree well with the experimental data, showing the potential use of OpenSees for determining hydrodynamic loads on engineered structures. Given the wide-ranging earthquake engineering simulation capabilities of OpenSees, these validations form a basis for simulating bridge responses to multihazard earthquake and tsunami scenarios.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cold reinforcement techniques refer to reinforcement methods that produce no or only low tensile residual stresses in structural details, avoiding new fatigue vulnerable details. To ensure the fatigue safety and extend the fatigue life of steel bridges, cold reinforcement techniques are proposed to stop the fatigue cracking of the critical details of orthotropic steel decks (OSDs) and web gap zones. Cold reinforcement techniques were evaluated by fatigue testing in the laboratory, in situ steel bridge case studies, and numerical fracture mechanics analysis using the extended FEM. Compared with drilling stop-holes, cold bonding of steel plates or bonding and bolting of steel angles have shown to effectively decrease local stresses, increase local rigidity, and extend fatigue lives. For in situ case studies on both a railway and a highway bridge, measured fatigue stress range spectra indicated that the bonding and bolting steel plate methods significantly enhance local rigidity and decrease local stresses. Numerical fracture mechanics results reveal fatigue stresses at the crack tip below the threshold of crack propagation.</abstract>

    <abstract>An increasing number of structures, and in particular pedestrian bridges, experience excessive vibration levels when they are dynamically excited by humans in motion. Although several models have been presented to incorporate the influence of a single pedestrian traversing a flexible structure, there is no commonly accepted method to include the presence of dynamic interactions that results in complex time-varying and coupled dynamics. This paper presents a new coupled model shown to be effective in modeling the coupled dynamics associated with pedestrianï¿½bridge interaction (PBI). Through a series of experiments involving three human subjects walking under different conditions, the model was validated in accordance to its capability to reproduce and replicate the complex vibration patterns observed on a full-scale bridge with a single pedestrian. The results demonstrate that the PBI model provides an effective and reliable approach to simulate humanï¿½structure interaction.</abstract>

    <abstract>During the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, the rollover of a truck crossing the Yokohama Bay cable-stayed bridge was reported. A similar incident was also reported at the viaduct of the Hanshin-Expressway during the 1995 Hanshin (or Kobe) earthquake. Rollover of a vehicle can cause damage to the bridge, injury to the driver, and damage to other vehicles. Moreover, the incident can create hours of blockage of the major traffic line and impede postdisaster relief efforts. Currently, there are very limited studies on the effect of the seismic response on the stability of moving vehicles. This paper presents a general analytical framework for the analysis of the lateral stability of a vehicle crossing a bridge during an earthquake. An equation of motion for a two-axle vehicle under seismic excitation from a bridge girder was developed considering in-plane and out-of-plane vehicle motions and a driver reaction model. Numerical simulations were conducted using three-dimensional finite elements of the Yokohama Bay cable-stayed bridge using ground accelerations recorded during the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake as the inputs. Results of the simulation showed that the significant bridge-deck vibration due to an earthquake reduces the effective normal force on vehicle wheels. To evaluate vehicle stability, two conditions were studied: rollover and lateral-slip stability. Rollover stability defines the critical condition that might lead to a rollover and that is related to zero normal force on the wheels. The lateral-slip stability relates to the lateral force equilibrium between the earthquake-induced lateral force and the slip resistance provided by wheel friction. Case studies and discussions involving different driving responses, such as deceleration, and the driverï¿½s reaction model were provided for both stability conditions.</abstract>

    <abstract>Super long-span bridges offer great convenience, but, because of their high decks, they also suffer from traffic safety problems related to strong winds. In this paper, large eddy simulation and dynamic mesh techniques for computational fluid dynamics are used to explore the aerodynamic forces acting on vehicles travelling on bridges and the mechanism of the aerodynamic interference between two vehicles during the processes of overtaking (from the same direction) and approaching (from opposite directions). The results indicate that during overtaking or approaching, the lateral aerodynamic interference between moving vehicles in a crosswind exhibits several characteristics that are fundamentally different from those of the interference between static vehicles. In the area behind a moving vehicle, a pressure cavity (a low-pressure zone) exerts a suction effect on the crosswind, which causes the crosswind in this region to change direction. This suction effect will markedly influence the aerodynamic force on another vehicle travelling in an adjacent lane in a crosswind, even when the latter vehicle is not directly sheltered by the former. The ratio of the velocities of the overtaking and overtaken vehicles exerts a significant influence on the aerodynamic forces that act on vehicles in a crosswind, and the transverse interval exerts a significant influence on the aerodynamic forces on both the windward and leeward vehicles. These lateral aerodynamic interferences cause vibrations of the vehicle and oscillations of the vehicleï¿½s contact forces with the bridge deck or road, which threaten its driving safety and comfort in a crosswind.</abstract>

    <abstract>Adjacent box-girder bridges are a popular choice for short- to intermediate-span bridges in several states because they are easy, quick to build, and cost-effective. Although longitudinal shear keys filled with grout between the girders and transverse posttensioning (TPT) ties ensure a monolithic behavior for the bridge, the durability of longitudinal shear keys still concerns researchers and engineers. Ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) has been adopted as a new grout material for connections between bridge components. However, there is not yet any guidance or specification on the design of UHPC shear key configuration for adjacent box-girder bridge connections. The aim of this study was to use experimental results and finite-element (FE) modeling of direct shear, flexural, and direct tension tests to optimize a UHPC shear key configuration. These models were calibrated and validated with laboratory experimental results previously published by the authors. The models, along with different shear key configurations, were used to investigate the load transfer through previously proposed connections. After comparing the simulated shear keys in terms of the maximum load capacity, the optimized shear key shape (Type OPT) was designed to obtain a desired balance between economy and strength effects. The results demonstrated the contribution of the shear key configuration to the joint strength, and suggest that Type OPT shear key significantly increased load transfer, resulting in an enhanced serviceability. Therefore, use of Type OPT shear keys in a bridge may reduce the number of transverse shear reinforcement bars required, which in turn would improve the constructability of the bridge and reduce material and construction costs.</abstract>

    <abstract>This article presents the observed cyclic responses of three types of metal hysteretic, axial dissipative devices (typically used with dissipative controlled rocking bridge piers) under varying degrees of corrosion. Dissipative controlled rocking bridge piers employ a combination of unbonded posttensioning tendons and external replaceable dissipaters. Unbonded posttensioning provides the ability to self-center, and dissipaters absorb seismic energy. The quality and properties of dissipaters decrease over time as a result of corrosion, which needs to be considered for capacity evaluations. The effects of chloride-induced corrosion on the hysteretic and cyclic response of these dissipaters were studied experimentally. To save time, the dissipaters, having equal length and cross-sectional area in the reduced area, were corroded using an accelerated corrosion technique called the impressed current method at a corrosion rate of 800 &#x3BC;A/cm2. Cyclic (tensile-compression) tests for 36 dissipaters in total were conducted under three levels of corrosion and two different deformation rates. This investigation has resulted in clear quantification of the relationship between the degree of corrosion and both cyclic and hysteretic properties of the dissipaters studied.</abstract>

    <abstract>A simplified scour model for tripod foundation taking into account both local scour and global scour is proposed in this paper. The model is incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model for analysis of a full-scale offshore wind turbine founded on a tripod structure using realistic structural properties. Applicability of the 3D finite element model is validated using full-scale load test data. Four different scour conditions under two wave situations are examined for the ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and fatigue limit state (FLS). The results show that scour has a minor effect on the natural frequency of the tripod-supported wind turbine but can significantly increase the maximum cross-sectional von Mises stress of piles under the ULS and increase the deflection of piles within nearly 20?m below the original seabed under the SLS. As for the fatigue life of the tripod structure, it can also be reduced by the effect of scour. These findings provide insights which are useful for development of safe and economic design of offshore wind turbines supported by tripod foundations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The structural integrity of precast concrete tunnel lining (PCTL) segments largely depends on its durability performance. The ingress of chloride ions into PCTL segments can induce reinforcement corrosion, which has been the primary cause that jeopardizes the structural safety of PCTL. This study explores the mechanical behavior of specimens extracted from full-scale PCTL segments made with conventional steel-rebar-reinforced concrete (RC) and steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) for a subway tunnel in Canada and subjected to chloride ions exposure. Test specimens were subjected to chloride ion (Cl&#x2212;) solutions with various concentrations (3.5 and 10.0%) for up to 16ï¿½months, combined with weekly wetting and drying cycles. The mechanical degradation of RC and SFRC specimens was assessed after every 4ï¿½months of chloride ions exposure. Initially, an increase in concrete mass by 0.84 and 0.35% was observed for RC and SFRC PCTL segments, respectively, after 4ï¿½months of 3.5% Cl&#x2212; exposure. However, after 8ï¿½months of Cl&#x2212; exposure, a decreasing trend in mass was observed for both the RC and SRFC specimens. Furthermore, results indicated that the mechanical properties of conventional RC PCTL segments were more vulnerable to chloride-induced damage compared to that of SFRC PCTL segments. For instance, 19 and 47% decreases in compressive and flexural strengths, respectively, were observed in RC specimens after 12ï¿½months of exposure to 3.5% Cl&#x2212; solution. Exposure to 10% Cl&#x2212; solution led to a greater reduction in the mechanical properties of RC specimens compared to that of 3.5% exposure. No significant decrease in compressive and flexural strengths was observed in SFRC specimens due to Cl&#x2212; exposure. Interestingly, the mechanical performance of SFRC specimens improved when subjected to chloride ions. Experimental results for both the RC and SFRC segments point to the potential of SFRC as a strong contender in the construction of precast concrete tunnel linings.</abstract>

    <abstract>The authors describe a model test to investigate the hydrodynamic response of a newly designed pontoon-type floating bridge under regular waves. The displacement of each module, the bending moment along the entire floating bridge and the mooring force were obtained. Obvious nonlinear hydroelastic effects can be found by analysing the bending moments for different wave heights, which might result from such factors as nonlinear connectors, nonlinear mooring or nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force. This finding indicates that nonlinear factors have a significant effect on bending moment and should be taken into account in the design of floating bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Scour is responsible for approximately 60% of all bridge collapses in the United States. A large number of bridges are listed in the National Bridge Inventory as scour critical; however, evaluating scour potential based on soil sampling and laboratory testing can be cost prohibitive, as erosion testing using available apparatuses is time consuming. Various soil characteristics that affect the erosion of soil also influence in situ bulk electrical resistivity (ER) measurements collected using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The objective of this study was to predict soil erodibility using ERT. Fourteen bridge sites were used for ERT and erosion testing. The results of this study indicate that an ER over 50ï¿½&#x3A9;m has a 93% probability of classifying the soil as high erodibility. As such, ERT can be used to rapidly prioritize existing bridges where soils near the surface are likely classified as highly erodible. These bridges would then require a more detailed investigation to characterize soil erosion potential. The application of using ERT to predict soil erodibility was validated using an additional experimental site.</abstract>

    <abstract>PmB 25 A and PmB 45 A Guï¿½asphalts (poured asphalts) are commonly used to pave orthotropic steel bridge deck surfaces, especially in Germany, because they are light, stiff, and easily applied. The behavior of asphalt is time- and temperature-dependent, so the stress-strain relationship is represented mathematically using viscoelasticity. Asphalt mixtures are not homogeneous but are composite mixtures, and the tensile and compression components of their stiffness moduli must be determined separately. Here, the time- and temperature-dependent stiffness moduli of PmB 25 A and PmB 45 A Guï¿½asphalts are derived using indirect tensile test and a new method to allow the creep compliances and relaxation moduli of PmB 25 A and PmB 45 A Guï¿½asphalt types to be determined at 25 and 40ï¿½C.</abstract>

    <abstract>The polynomial chaos expansion method was used to perform probabilistic analysis on a tunnel face driven in rock masses. The generalized Hoek-Brown (HB) failure criterion was used to characterize the strength of rock masses. Deterministic calculations of required face pressures were based on the upper bound limit analysis theory. Four HB input parameters, the geological strength index (GSI), the uniaxial compressive strength &#x3C3;c of the intact rock, the constant mi, and the disturbance factor Di, were considered as random variables. The influence of HB input parameter uncertainties on probability density functions of the required face pressures, sensitivity analysis, and failure probabilities were discussed with respect to different coefficients of variance (COVs), distribution types, and correlation coefficients. A reliability-based design was performed to compute probabilistic face pressures under different COVs at a target safety level. The obtained results show uncertainties in the input random variables have an important influence on the required face pressures, and it is necessary to analyze the problem in the probabilistic framework.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper evaluates a nonmicrobial means of carbonate precipitation to heal cracks in concrete. Enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation (EICP) that relies on plant-derived urease enzyme is used to catalyze the reaction between calcium chloride and urea to precipitate calcium carbonate. The faster rate of carbonate precipitation and the absence of microbes makes this method attractive for surface applications for crack healing of concrete. Notched mortar beams in which precracking is induced are subjected to EICP solutions with different CaCl2 concentrations and a fixed molar ratio of urea&#x2236;CaCl2 of 1.2. X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis of samples collected from the vicinity of the notch clearly demonstrate the presence of calcium carbonate in the cracks. A flexural strength enhancement of approximately 33% is observed for mortars treated with an EICP solution made using 0.5ï¿½M CaCl2 compared with the mortars that are just moist cured, and the fracture toughness doubled. The strength and fracture parameters (fracture toughness and critical crack tip opening displacement) scale well with the carbonate content. Digital image correlation (DIC) is used to quantify the reduction in crack extension after the beams are treated with the EICP solution.</abstract>

    <abstract>In cable-stayed bridges, cable anchorages are subject to significant forces in the structure and carry a heavy stress concentration. The structural features and cable-force transfer pathway of four typical cable-girder anchorages in cable-stayed bridges with steel girders were introduced. Finite-element analysis (FEA) and a full-scale specimen test were performed to investigate the mechanical behavior of tensile-plate anchorages. Stress distribution and stress concentration of tensile-plate anchorages were obtained by combining the results of the FEA and experiments. The effect of design parameters on the mechanical behavior of tensile-plate anchorages was also investigated by the FEA. Test results confirmed that the anchorage is designed reasonably and reliably with a large safety margin. According to the parametric studies, fillet radius significantly affects the stress field of the local fillet zone. Also, the welding tensile plate with extended web shows the best work performance for tensile-plate anchorages.</abstract>

    <abstract>Since its completion in 1976, Osstrupen Bridge in Norway has sagged about 250&#x2009;mm beyond its original precamber at the midspan hinge. Since the general state of the bridge is good, a solution was sought for raising the girder back to its target configuration while also strengthening it. It was determined to add an internal arch composed of two parallel tubes, hidden in the box and continuous at the center. The tubes are jacked at both ends and the uplifting forces are transferred to the girder through interconnections composed of trusses, which also prevent the tubes from buckling. Two alternative materials were considered for the tubes: high-strength steel and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The paper presents the mechanical response of the two types of coupled systems during jacking operations, under service loads, and when subjected to temperature variations. CFRP has the advantages of a low weight and a low coefficient of thermal expansion, giving a somewhat higher uplift and stress relief to the girder, as well as lower deflection due to ambient temperature variations. Both choices of material were shown to work well and to possess sufficient buckling resistance. For the bridge, a nearly full recovery of the sag at the hinge can be expected, with the extra weight of a new wearing course being accounted for. After rehabilitation, the bridge will carry heavier vehicles than it was originally designed for.</abstract>

    <abstract>Galloping vibrations have been identified as potentially problematic for dry stay cables. Three key issues play a major role in the assessment of the structural damping required to prevent galloping of dry stay cables using a quasi-steady approach: the complex inclined-flow aerodynamics, deviation of the geometry of the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) stay cover with respect to that of a perfectly circular cylinder, and choice of a proper stability criterion. In this paper, the mean aerodynamic force coefficients of a real HDPE plain cable cover measured in a wind tunnel are presented. These were obtained by varying wind speed, yaw angle, and angle of attack, and they represent a complete set of aerodynamic data. Cable irregularities (surface roughness, section distortion, and axis curvature) were quantified and correlated to the measured aerodynamics. The experimental aerodynamic coefficients were used to predict instability using different quasi-steady models from the literature on a reference case. Finally, the different exciting and dissipating mechanisms deriving from the application of one- and two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) stability models, together with the corresponding different response predictions, are discussed in detail. It is shown that cable irregularities and detuning direction exert strong influences on aerodynamic stability and that instability is mainly due to critical Reynolds number effects. Moreover, a comparison of the results shows that the use of multi-DOF models is not justified in this case because one-DOF models prove sufficiently accurate to predict the amount of structural damping required to prevent galloping instability.</abstract>

    <abstract>Precast concrete facilitates a construction method using durable and rapidly erectable prefabricated members to create cost-effective and high-quality structures. In this method, the connections between the precast members as well as between the members and the foundation require special attention to ensure good seismic performance. Extensive research conducted since the 1980s has led to new precast concrete structural systems, designs, details, and techniques that are particularly suited for use in regions of high seismic hazard. This paper reviews the state of the art of these advances, including code developments and practical applications, related to four different systems: (1)ï¿½moment frames; (2)ï¿½structural walls; (3)ï¿½floor diaphragms; and (4)ï¿½bridges. It is concluded from this review that the widespread use of precast concrete in seismic regions is feasible today and that the jointed connection innovation introduced through precast research leads to improved seismic performance of building and bridge structures.</abstract>

    <abstract>On December 4, 2015, the President signed into law the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) (P.L. 114-94), which includes new truck size and weight provisions that effect bridge load rating and posting requirements. Among those provisions is the exemption of emergency vehicles from meeting the nationwide Interstate truck weight limits set forth in 23 U.S.C. 127(a). The emergency vehicles exempted from these weight limits by the FAST Act can create greater load effects in certain bridges than the previous legal loads. Research needs to be undertaken to establish whether existing load factors, multiple presence factors based on likely traffic situations, and exposure intervals as specified in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual for Bridge Evaluation are appropriate for the emergency vehicles; further these load factors may need to be developed or calibrated to the reliability analysis in the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation. 
The objective of this research is to propose modifications to the load factors for the emergency vehicles in the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (load factor rating ï¿½LFRï¿½ and load and resistance factor rating ï¿½LRFRï¿½). For the LRFR, the load factors shall be calibrated to the reliability analysis in the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation with appropriate modifications. 
Task 1. Review the FAST Act provisions regarding emergency vehicles and other available references such as Federal Highway Administration's (FHWAï¿½)s QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ï¿½ Load Rating for the FAST Actï¿½s Emergency Vehicles (March 2017) and other FHWA Technical Guidance. 
Task 2. Establish multiple presence factors appropriate for the FAST Act emergency vehicles using recent traffic data. Include in the calibration the effect of multiple presence factors, discuss or determine the necessity to include emergency vehicles in combination with lane loads for longer spans, the utilization of striped lanes or positioning the emergency vehicle for maximum effect, and the appropriate use of dynamic load impact, etc.
Task 3. Perform a standard calibration process consistent with the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation to determine load factors corresponding to current resistance factors for the FAST Act emergency vehicles. 
Task 4. Submit a draft letter report for Tasks 1 through 3 no later than 6 months after contract award. NCHRP approval will be required before proceeding with the remaining tasks. 
Task 5. Propose modifications to the load factors (load intensity, impact, lane loads, etc.) in the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation for both LFR and LRFR methods with examples. Submit the proposed modifications for NCHRP review. 
Task 6. Present the research findings to the AASHTO Committee on Bridges and Structures, Technical Committee T18ï¿½Management, Evaluation, and Rehabilitation. 
Task 7. Revise the proposed modifications according to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) project panel comments. 
Task 8. Submit the final report describing the entire research. Following receipt of the draft final report, the remaining 2 months shall be for NCHRP review and comment and for research agency preparation of the revised final report.</abstract>

    <abstract>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has employed a variety of technology, tactical infrastructure, and personnel assets to help secure the nearly 2,000 mile long southwest border. Since 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued over 35 products on the progress and challenges DHS has faced in using technology, infrastructure, and other resources to secure the border. GAO has made over 50 recommendations to help improve DHSï¿½s efforts, and DHS has implemented more than half of them. This statement by Rebecca Gambler, Director, Homeland Security &amp; Justice, addresses (1) DHS efforts to deploy and measure the effectiveness of surveillance technologies, (2) DHS efforts to maintain and assess the effectiveness of existing tactical infrastructure and to deploy new physical barriers, and (3) staffing challenges the Border Patrol has faced. This statement is based on three GAO reports issued in 2017, selected updates conducted in 2017, and ongoing work related to DHS acquisitions and the construction of physical barriers. For ongoing work GAO analyzed DHS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  documents, interviewed officials within DHS, and visited border areas in California. In recent reports, GAO made or reiterated recommendations for DHS to, among other things, assess the contributions of technology and fencing to border security. DHS generally agreed, and has actions planned or underway to address these recommendations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridges exposed to flooding, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other extreme hydrologic events have been observed to fail due to deck dislodgement, pier failure, or foundation failure. However, the risk assessment and retrofit methodologies for these bridges have typically only been developed around a single failure mode. This paper addresses this gap by integrating the three observed failure modes for bridges vulnerable to extreme hydraulic events into a comprehensive risk assessment framework. Through the use of an event tree, the methodology accounts for the different consequences of failure associated with different failure modes. Bridge management strategies are investigated to determine the effectiveness of the retrofit actions with respect to their benefit (i.e. reduction in risk) and costs. An illustrative example for riverine bridges under various exposure scenarios is presented. The risk assessment and benefit-cost analysis elucidate the need to incorporate all pertinent failure modes of the structure by highlighting the competing nature of different failure modes. The illustrative example shows that the effective management of structures is site-specific and, that the intensity of the hazard at the bridge location affects which management strategy is preferred. The sensitivity to exposure level indicates that the optimal management of the structure should incorporate considerations for potential future changes in the intensity and frequency of the hazard.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper is devoted to identify the effect of soil-structure interaction on the dynamic response of a portal frame railway bridge. The study aims to validate the accuracy of numerical models in evaluating the dynamic stiffness and modal properties of the bridgeï¿½soil system. To achieve this aim, a controlled vibration test has been performed on a full-scale portal frame bridge to determine the modal properties of the system through measuring Frequency Response Functions. The results of the dynamic test provide reference data for FE model calibration as well as valuable information about the dynamic behavior of this type of bridges. Using the experimental data, an FRF-based model updating procedure was used to calibrate a full 3D solid model involving the entire bridge-track-soil system. Both measured and computed responses identify the substantial contribution of the surrounding soil on the global damping of the system and highlight the importance of the soilï¿½structure interaction on the dynamic response of this type of bridges. The identified modal damping ratio corresponding to the fundamental bending mode of the studied bridge was nearly 5 times higher than the recommended design values. A simplified model for the surrounding soil was also proposed in order to attain a less complicated model appropriate for practical design purposes.</abstract>

    <abstract>The blast performances of concrete-filled double-skin steel tube (CFDST) columns subjected to contact explosion were investigated experimentally and numerically in the present study. Field tests were carried out on three circular CFDST column specimens under contact explosion, and different damage modes were observed from the tests. Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulations coupled with Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) algorithms that are available in the explicit nonlinear dynamic analysis program LS-DYNA were utilized to develop the numerical models. The feasibility and accuracy of the numerical models were verified against the experimental results. After that, the numerical models were used to further investigate the dynamic response, damage evolution, and energy absorption mechanism of CFDST columns subjected to contact explosion. The results indicate that CFDST columns under contact explosion are likely to suffer a localized damage while exhibits almost no global responses. The localized damage concentrates in the vicinity of the detonation zone, including cratering around the detonation point, fracture or rupture failure of the outer steel tube, and breaching failure in the front sandwich wall. The core concrete failure plays a dominant role in the energy absorbing mechanism of CFDST columns owing to the confinement effect provided by the steel tubes. In addition, the presence of the outer steel tube can effectively prevent the concrete spall damage thus mitigating the potential damage to personnel and equipment caused by ejected fragments.</abstract>

    <abstract>Mobile impact testing of a simply-supported steel stringer bridge is investigated for efficient structural flexibility identification. The classical impact test method requires a number of sensors deployed on the entire structure; in contrast, this paper proposes a novel mobile impact test method that sequentially measures segments of the entire structure with much fewer sensors. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in that it greatly reduces the experimental cost, and it can output the same results of the entire structureï¿½s flexibility matrix as the traditional impact test method. In the proposed method, the data processing algorithm is developed to integrate the measurements of all segments for identifying the entire structureï¿½s flexibility matrix. Especially, it does not need any transitional nodes to be references by adopting the principle of minimum potential energy, which greatly improves the efficiency of mobile impact testing. Application of the proposed approach to a simply-supported steel stringer bridge successfully verifies its feasibility and efficiency.</abstract>

    <abstract>The strategies adopted to cope with extreme hurricane and tsunami events in the United States have been reactive rather than proactive. While reactive actions are necessary after extreme events, the frequency and intensity of recent hurricanes demonstrated the need for taking proactive actions to prevent major damages.
A crucial step toward addressing this need is to accurately quantify the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to extreme hurricane storms. Hence, the main goal of this project is to evaluate the structural vulnerability of coastal bridge structures to hydrodynamic loads generated under extreme hurricane conditions along the Texas-Louisiana coastline. This research will analyze the most common bridge types (i.e. several girder bridge configurations) with the aim of identifying structures that are most and least resilient to hurricane waves and storm surge. Finite element based simulations will be conducted to quantify the magnitude of the hydrodynamic loads under different hurricane sea states. Vulnerability curves will be developed to assess the potential damage of the bridge structures to specified hurricane scenarios. This information will be used to design and propose strategies that minimize structural damage during an extreme hurricane event, e.g. connections that prevent unseating of the superstructure.   </abstract>

    <abstract>As many studies have manifested that drilled shafts behave significantly differently under combined loads, this study focuses on investigating the lateral response of a drilled shaft that is subjected to a combination of vertical and lateral loads.  In particular, this study is limited to assess the condition that the vertical load is applied prior to the lateral load.  This scenario occurs to a drilled shaft supporting a bridge is subjected to hurricane load.  Therefore, large-scale testing and numerical simulation will be performed to assess the effect of load ratio, drilled shaft head fixity, and cyclic loading on the lateral response of a drilled shaft built in stiff clay when a vertical load is present.  Based on the data, the effect will be quantified in term of lateral deflections under different conditions. In addition, this project will focus on modifying the existing p-y curves to assist the analysis and design of drilled shafts that are subjected to combined vertical and lateral loads. This project will provide urgently needed information to address the safety and sustainability of the critical infrastructures of Region 6, as drilled shafts are widely used to support bridges, and retaining walls.       </abstract>

    <abstract>Data from governmental agencies shows a clear exponential growth in damages and costs due to extreme weather events in the U.S. Most critical infrastructure built in urban areas, including that for transportation and flood protection are designed to handle a design storm with a 1% probability of occurrence in one year or 100 years of return period. Superstorms are defined here as rainfall storm events with return periods higher than 100 years and have occurred lately in the U.S. In the absence of new hydrologic and hydraulic modeling frameworks as well as educational opportunities for the current and future generation of engineers, the impacts of super storms will only increase negatively affecting critical infrastructure, the economy, the environment and communities. Hence, the main goal of this project is to develop and apply a computational framework capable of predicting the impacts of super storms in the transportation infrastructure and evaluating flood protection strategies that alleviate some of the impacts in highly populated urban areas. The case study is the City of San Antonio, TX, which lays within a flood-prone region in Texas referred as the Flash Flood Alley. </abstract>

    <abstract>Roadways represent an important part of transportation infrastructure, serving as a backbone to enable better mobility for people and goods. Because roadways greatly impact the economic growth and development of communities, state-of-the-art research has focused on planning, designing, and constructing roadways to reduce environmental impact, increase sustainability, and improve the efficiency of transportation flow. However, due to increasingly large demands for reduced driver stress, independent mobility for non-drivers, and increased safety and in-vehicle infotainment, further research is called for on the development of novel roadways that can adapt for future vehicles (e.g., electric or self-driving cars).
Inspired by the great amount of renewable energy sources available on the roadways such as mechanical pressure and frictional heat, and aiming to tackle todayï¿½s challenges caused by the limited battery capacity of modern electric and self-driving cars, this research project will explore, develop and implement innovative smart charging techniques for vehicles of the future (electric and self-driving cars) ï¿½ namely, smart and illuminative charging (SIC) ï¿½ by integrating existing roadways, state-of-the-art nanomaterials and power electronics technologies to create a smart, sustainable transportation infrastructure. </abstract>

    <title>Toward Corrosion-Free and Highly Sustainable Structural Members by Using Emerging Ultra-High-Performance Materials for Transportation Infrastructure</title>

    <abstract>The proposed research aims to develop next-generation highly corrosion-resistant structural members by utilizing the high durability, compressive ductility, crack resistance and shear strength of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-FRC). The use of high-strength fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars can reduce reinforcement congestion while achieving a high structural efficiency (that is, high flexural strength with a smaller cross-section), as well as eliminate the corrosion concern prevalent in conventional steel reinforced concrete members. The high shear strength of UHP-FRC allows total or substantial elimination of supplemental shear reinforcement.  The combination of the very ductile UHP-FRC with the brittle but high-strength FRP bars can provide the corrosion-free characteristics needed for future concrete infrastructure. The primary parameters to be investigated include 1) types of FRP bars (glass fiber, carbon fiber or basalt fiber); 2) fiber types of UHP-FRC: high-strength micro steel fibers and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fibers), and 3) shear reinforcement (steel, FRP, or none). The primary objective is to develop a design procedure for the new durable structural members through large-scale beam testing. The economics of using the proposed UHP-FRC/FRP members can be justified as follows: 1) The much higher stiffness and strength properties allow lighter, longer, and fewer members to be used. This, in turn, saves construction time and labor cost. 2) UHP-FRC has a high early strength of 10 to 12 ksi after 24 hours. This will allow rapid construction and overall savings in time and costs. 3) Eliminating most shear reinforcement leads to simple design and construction. 4) Lower life-cycle costs will be incurred due to the sustainability and corrosion-resistance capability of UHP-FRC. Thus, savings will accrue due to less initial maintenance and repair and fewer social, environmental, and demolition expenses. </abstract>

    <abstract>Control of thermal expansion is a critical goal of engineering design in a wide range of applications, particularly in cases where system components are small, are subject to large changes (gradients) in temperatures, or require extreme dimensional stability over a wide range of temperatures. In particular, the thermal expansion of concrete plays a significant role in the durability of the transportation infrastructure and causes misalignment, cracking, and structural failure. As such, the objective of this study is to improve the durability and extend the life of transportation infrastructure using multifunctional materials. This research aims to use high-performance materials such as shape memory components to address the issue of thermal expansion integrated into next-generation designs, to enhance the longevity and safety of these structures. As a result, the more specific objective of this research is to design and characterize the use of multifunctional materials that stabilize the changing structure due to thermal expansion. The characteristics of these materials will work in conjunction with the temperature dependence of concrete. This will require very specific properties from the materials, making trained shape memory alloys (SMAs) a likely candidate, to meet the characteristics required to address the problem statement. The methods to train the materials should be developed in a repeatable fashion, and their adaptability demonstrated as a function of temperature and stress from the thermal expansion of the concrete. </abstract>

    <abstract>Shape memory alloy (SMAs) can produce large recoverable deformations triggered by stress in a response known as superelasticity. This response has been shown to limit the damage sustained by the structure from adverse events such as earthquakes, and have been considered in a range of civil engineering applications.  The most widespread SMA candidate for such applications is the nickel-titanium (NiTi) SMA, which is cost-prohibitive for large-scale applications.  Instead, the research team proposes a low-cost and easily processed iron (Fe)-based SMA as an alternative.  Furthermore, the iron-based SMA shows an interesting meta-magnetic shape memory response, where a change in induced magnetization of the material occurs from applied stress and can be easily detected using commercial magnetometers. This property can be harnessed to create a method to monitor the stresses and strains on structural systems with iron-based SMAs remotely and in a non-destructive fashion.  The combination of these properties enable a new kind of structural health monitoring framework where the load-bearing and sensing elements are the same, and quantitative information could be collected in real-time with simple instruments. The goal of the proposed project is to create large dimension iron-based SMA rods and that are suitable for structural and transportation applications and determine the maximum part size. This study will also demonstrate bulk-Fe-SMA rods and cables that are capable of sustaining high stress and elongation.  Optimal configuration of rods and sensors will be computationally determined through combined magnetic-mechanical modeling and validated through experiments.  For the implementation phase of the project, the team will show that the strain in large size iron-based SMA rods and cables directly correlates with changes in its magnetic response.
