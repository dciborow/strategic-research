***ask question first in order to determine metric/visualization.

metrics:

project count by category/topic
funding amount by category/topic
category/topic by location
sub-topic by category
funding by gerography
funding by bridge performance
funding agency by category/topic
research by component/material



*funding (where are dollars being spent?, who is spending? what are they spending it on?)
*funding vs distribution of bridge condition (correlating condition with research dollars)

* aggregate numbers (e.g. research dollars per bridge)

Later...(avg age vs avg cost)
