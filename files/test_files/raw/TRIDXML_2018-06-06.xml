    <abstract>Steel box girder bridges are being used on a more and more widespread basis as they represent an alternative to steel I-girder bridges. Designers can be tempted to specify very thin/slender bottom flanges for steel box girders in positive moment regions (where the bottom flange is in tension). However, specifying too thin or too slender of a bottom flange could result in problems during fabrication, transportation, erection, or future inspection/maintenance, and potential strength and fatigue issues. 
 
Currently there is no consensus on minimum thickness and maximum slenderness limits for steel box girder bottom flanges. Industry recommendations on minimum bottom flange thicknesses vary, but are generally in the range of �� to 1�. Industry recommendations for bottom flange width to thickness (b/t) slenderness ratios also vary, generally over a range from 80 to 135. Since there are currently no limits in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design specifications, designs with even higher slenderness ratios are not precluded. The objective of this project is to propose AASHTO guidelines for the minimum thickness and maximum slenderness limits for steel box girder bottom flanges to (1) minimize issues during fabrication, handling, and erection; and (2) enhance the long-term performance of steel box girders.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridges constructed with adjacent precast prestressed concrete box beams have been in service for many years and provide an economical solution for short and medium span bridges. A recurring problem is cracking in the longitudinal grouted joints between adjacent beams, resulting in reflective cracks forming in the asphalt wearing surface or concrete deck. The cracking appears to be initiated by, but not limited, to stresses caused by temperature gradients, live loads, transverse post-tensioning, or grout shrinkage. Once the cracking has occurred, chloride-laden water can penetrate the cracks and cause corrosion of the reinforcement and prestressing strand.

NCHRP Synthesis 393: Adjacent Precast Concrete Box Beam Bridges: Connection Details reported a wide variety of practices used by state highway agencies for the connection details between adjacent box beams. These practices include partial depth or full depth grouted keyways, keyways grouted before or after transverse post-tensioning, prepackaged or non-prepackaged grout materials, post-tensioned or non-tensioned transverse ties, a wide range of applied transverse post-tensioning forces, and cast-in-place concrete decks or no decks. A few states reported that their practices had reduced the longitudinal cracking, whereas others had not been successful using similar practices.

In 2014, FHWA conducted extensive evaluation of the use of the ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) connections for adjacent box beam bridges to address the connection performance. In fact, the FHWA-developed UHPC connections have been used by some states.

Since the previous research focused on the connections� performance as an individual component, there is a need to evaluate their performance as part of an overall adjacent precast box beam bridge system. In addition, new adjacent precast box beam bridge systems could be developed by integrating both proven and innovative connections.

The objectives of this research are to (1) develop guidelines for the design and construction of various adjacent precast box beam bridge systems to enhance performance of connections and bridge service life and (2) propose design and construction specifications with commentary in the format of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concerns about long-term corrosion of bridge deck reinforcement and degradation of the surrounding concrete have led to innovative approaches to protect steel rebar and reduce concrete cracking in Minnesota. First, a population of approximately 661 bridge decks were built between 1975 and 1989 with an epoxy-coated rebar top mat and uncoated black bar bottom mat to protect the top layer of steel reinforcement from corrosion. Most of these structures are still in service and have not been re-decked. Second, approximately 20 bridge decks have been constructed in the last five years with polypropylene fibers in the concrete mix to reduce the width and amount of deck cracking. To determine if the use of epoxy-coated top mat rebar or polypropylene fibers has affected the rate of deck deterioration, the objectives of this project include answering the following questions: 
1. How are fiber reinforced bridge decks performing compared to control group twin structures constructed without fibers?
2. How are the epoxy-coated top mat and uncoated bottom mat bridge decks performing compared to control group twin structures constructed without mixed rebar decks (e.g., epoxy-coated top and bottom mat rebar or uncoated top and bottom mat rebar)?
3. What type of deterioration is being observed (e.g., spalling of underside of deck concrete or unsound concrete on the top wearing surface)?
4. Should a preventative maintenance plan be developed for bridges built with epoxy-coated top mat and uncoated bottom mat rebar? Should this plan be different depending on the feature under the bridge?
To achieve the objectives, researchers will evaluate bridge inspection reports to identify variation in different types of condition ratings and rate of deterioration between bridges built with mixed rebar decks, fiber reinforced deck concrete, and control group twin structures. Furthermore, researchers will conduct on-site visual inspections to determine if bridges built with epoxy-coated top mat rebar or fiber reinforced deck concrete have less/more visual degradation when compared to control group visual inspection results. Inspection report data will be used to determine if the deck condition ratings are better/worse for the epoxy-coated top mat bridge decks compared to the accompanying control group twin structures. If condition ratings are worse, researchers will work with MnDOT to determine if a preventative maintenance plan should be developed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Maintenance of deteriorating bridges is a pressing need throughout the U.S., and for the Mountain-Plains area in particular, as these infrastructure are critical to economic performance. In the maintenance process, condition evaluation of this sector of the infrastructure is critical, as it informs repair decisions, load-rating and management of limited state resources. Throughout the Mountain-Plains region, the condition of nearly 25,000 bridges must be evaluated by state departments of transportation (DOTs) regularly. In Colorado, the condition of a total of 8,612 state owned and local bridges are inspected routinely (typically every two years) by Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and consultants. About 540 of these bridges are rated as structurally-deficient bridges and thus typically need more frequent inspection and monitoring. The cost of bridge inspection forms the basis of much of the bridge management budget for CDOT, which varies from about $4.5 to $10 million annually. Considering the need for frequent inspection of a large number of bridges in the state and the significant expense, an efficient and cost-effective bridge inspection system is highly desirable. In current practice, the condition assessment of bridges mainly relies on human-based visual inspection, which often requires inspectors to climb ladders or use specialized equipment such as a "cherry-picker" to be lifted into place. This type of inspection is not only expensive and interrupts traffic, but also poses a danger to inspectors, especially in the Mountain-Plains region where mountain bridges can be difficult to access. In addition, the condition ratings reported by the inspectors might not be consistent due to the subjectivity of individual experience and difficult inspection conditions. The significant cost, safety issues, traffic interruption, as well as the subjective nature in current bridge inspection practice highlight the need to explore a fast, low-cost, quantitative and safe solution for bridge condition assessment.
Recently, remote sensing technology based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a promising technique to provide such a solution. It has already attracted significant attention from both federal and some state DOTs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been working diligently to safely promote drone use to spur job growth, advance critical scientific research and save lives. The first regulations for routine commercial use of small UAVs (weighing less than 55 pounds) released by the FAA in June, 2016 are the result of this effort and are expected to create new opportunities for research communities and government use of drones. Recent research has focused on investigations to use drones for inspecting bridges, large retaining walls, dams, buildings, poles, etc. (Eschmann et al. 2013; Ellenberg et al. 2014; Hallermann and Morgenthal 2014; Hallermann et al. 2014; Khan et al. 2015; Sa et al. 2015). Different remote sensing technologies have been employed in tandem with UAVs. The most common technologies are based on optical and thermographic cameras. A number of potential applications for UAVs in infrastructure inspection have been identified, including quantitative measurement of displacement of structures (Ellenberg et al. 2014; Hallermann et al. 2014; Khan et al. 2015), detection of both surface and subsurface damages (e.g. cracks, spalling and scale of concrete, delamination) (Chen et al. 2011; Eschmann et al. 2013; Ellenberg et al. 2014), georeferencing the collected images (Harwin and Lucieer 2012; Hallermann et al. 2014), 3D reconstruction of structures (Eschmann et al. 2013; Mauriello and Froehlich 2014; Sa et al. 2015), etc.
Given the unique potential of UAV based remote sensing technology, the proposed research aims to develop and demonstrate a UAV-based bridge inspection framework (Fig. 1). This research is expected to provide the bridge management sectors (e.g. state DOTs) with a highly efficient, cost-effective, quantitative and safe proof-of-concept for bridge inspection. The ultimate goal of this research theme is to develop an automated and quantitative bridge inspection procedure that requires minimum human intervention. The automated procedure includes data (images) acquisition using the UAV, 3D reconstruction of surface models of bridges, identification, localization and quantification of structural damage and documentation of the geo-referenced bridge inspection data in database. This end goal will be achieved in two phases of studies. The first phase is the feasibility study, while the second phase is the development of machine learning tools to fully automate the data post-processing and damage identification process. This proposal will address the first phase of this research theme.</abstract>

    <abstract>Reliable and accurate assessment and prediction of the condition deterioration of bridges is critical for effective bridge preservation, which can help extend the service life of bridges. Bridge inspection serves as an important task in assessing the current condition of bridges. The inspection data over time can also help establish condition deterioration models to predict bridge conditions in the future. The deterioration models combined with the information on the current condition can help guide inspection, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation planning, and can also be incorporated for risk and life-cycle analysis. Therefore, it is very important to develop deterioration models that can better predict the condition deterioration of bridges and bridge elements.
Bridge deterioration is influenced by many factors and is usually a result of many complex (deterioration) processes, e.g., corrosion, concrete degradation, cracking, fatigue (Agrawal et al. 2010). In the absence of good mechanistic-based deterioration models, deterioration models (e.g., Markov chains, Weibull-based models) established based on bridge inspection data are commonly used by state departments of transportation (DOTs) for bridge asset management and have been incorporated in bridge management systems such as AASHTOWare Bridge (Agrawal et al. 2010). Existing Markov deterioration models in bridge management systems usually assume stationary transition probability matrix (i.e., assuming homogenous deterioration process), while in reality the deterioration process is non-homogeneous (Dinesh Devaraj 2009) and the deterioration rate could be different for each bridge or bridge element, considering the differences in influencing factors (or explanatory variables) such as age, climate environment, protective systems, and other external conditions (e.g., traffic conditions). Also, it is assumed that the condition does not improve (i.e., the "do nothing" assumption) and there is no jumping in condition states (which could happen depending on the inspection interval and the deterioration rate) (Kallen 2009). Typically, optimization approaches are used to establish the transition probability matrix; however, they suffer from drawbacks such as noninvertible matrix and negative transition probabilities (Wellalage et al. 2013). More general stochastic models that can capture the nonhomogeneous nature of the deterioration process are needed, and so are calibration approaches that can establish proper transition probability matrices.
In terms of inspection data, most of the states have been collecting some element-level bridge condition data (Rehm 2013). Although there is more than a decade of inspection data (Farrar and Newton 2014; Rehm 2013), the data have not been fully utilized. One key issue that needs to be addressed is the large variability/uncertainty in the inspection data (stemming from various sources). One contributing source is the subjectivity of the inspection process. For example, it has been reported in (Graybeal et al. 2003) that out of the assigned condition ratings for the same structure by 49 bridge inspectors from 25 state departments only 68% of them fall within �1 interval around the mean while an interval of �2 would be needed to capture 95% of the assigned ratings. How to incorporate the uncertainties in the inspection data in a systematic way is an important issue that needs to be addressed to establish more robust deterioration models. This aspect has not been explicitly considered. Research is needed in how to effectively leverage the inspection data to establish better deterioration models and to predict bridge conditions at the element-level to guide cost-effective maintenance decision making.
Overall, there is a need to develop systematic and robust approaches that can extract useful and accurate information from the inspection data and can accommodate more general models for the deterioration process.
To address the above challenges, this project aims to develop general age and state dependent stochastic deterioration models using inspection data for improved element-level condition deterioration prediction of bridges. Also, a Bayesian framework will be established to facilitate systematic and robust calibration of the deterioration models incorporating the inspection data and various uncertainties.</abstract>

    <abstract>Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) uses pier and abutment types that may be constructed in aquatic environments without cofferdams. Typically, just formwork and erosion control will be used during these construction operations of a number of our pier and abutment types. These types of substructures include the WisDOT Bridge Manual Pile Encased Pier (Standard 13.03), A1 Integral Abutment (Standard 12.01), and A5 Pile Encased Abutment (Standard 12.08). Construction of piers or abutments without cofferdams in aquatic environments can be challenging and at times and the quality of the products may be less than desirable. There may be issues in adequately excavating to the desired bottom of pier elevation and maintaining the excavation open so that adequate embedment into the streambed can be attained. During placement of concrete under water, there have been issues with segregation of the concrete and loss of the cement paste. As a result, quality and strength of the concrete can be greatly compromised to the point that week concrete that can be easily removed by probing with hand tools. This concrete quality issue may also pertain to challenges with placements of seals in cofferdam/pier construction.
Factors during placement may include water velocities, depth of water, method of confinement, method of placement, or concrete mix design. These issues lead to concrete that is highly compromised with respect to strength and long-term performance. Some questions that also need to be addressed relate to the type of inspection that is desired to help ensure the appropriate level of quality. This may include the need or benefit for diving inspection after installation and/or other remote inspection technology.
This research synthesis report aims at assessing WisDOT current policy, standards, and specifications, the policy and practices of other DOTs, and current industry practices (including other marine environment construction industries) to provide guidance to be used in improving WisDOT policy, standards, and specifications related to underwater concrete placement.
The objective of this research is to examine best practices of DOTs and other related industries related to placement of concrete underwater and make recommendations to WisDOT Manuals, standards, specifications, and policy that will promote higher quality concrete substructures in aquatic environments.</abstract>

    <abstract>In cold climate zones, deicing chemicals are applied to roads and bridge decks to melt snow and ice to help maintain safe traffic operations. Bridges are vulnerable to the use of deicing chemicals that may include chlorides. Over time, chlorides infiltrate the concrete deck and reach reinforcement within the deck. Most deicing chemicals have a detrimental effect to the long-term condition of the bridge deck by promoting corrosion of the deck reinforcement and deterioration of the concrete.
Bridge owners are faced with a number of strategies and tools to maximize the life of bridge decks. Many of these tools include crack filling and penetrant sealers or crack filling and/or thin overlays that are applied as methods to retard the infiltration of chlorides or to seal the deck from these chlorides. Penetrant sealers generally require more frequent (4-5 years) applications than thin polymer overlays (10-12 years). However, the application cost of the penetrant sealer is significantly less than the thin polymer overlay.
The objective of this research is to develop recommendations and guidelines for protocols on the use of crack and penetrant deck sealers and thin polymer overlays. The recommendations should take the form of a lifecycle guide that would efficiently maximize the condition and longevity of bridge decks. The lifecycle guide should address progressive strategies and treatments (i.e., penetrant sealers, crack sealing, thin overlay, concrete overlay, deck replacement, etc.) and the transition points in the bridge deck criteria in which the optimal treatment should be applied to
the bridge deck (i.e. age, condition state, presence of chlorides, etc.), as well as the application frequency, and the point in the lifecycle where the treatment is no longer an effective or economical strategy.</abstract>

    <abstract>The corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete is the leading cause of deterioration for reinforced concrete structures, especially bridges. Practitioners and researchers have evaluated and implemented various technologies to combat this problem, including the use of high-performance concrete, chemical corrosion inhibitors, sealers and barriers, and alternative reinforcement. This project will address the latter, specifically the use of alternative reinforcement (e.g., fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement, epoxycoated steel, stainless steel, galvanized steel, etc.) to extend the service life of bridge structures subjected to external chlorides from marine environments or from de-icing salt applications. The primary goals of this project will be to (a) review and synthesize published literature, (b) review and synthesize current DOT practice, and (c) provide recommendations on how to evaluate and select alternative reinforcement for bridges subjected to external chlorides. It is important to note that this project will cover both materials and structural aspects associated with alternative reinforcement as these two facets are intimately linked. This project will ultimately provide technical recommendations needed to design and construct bridges that are structurally sound, taking into account the unique behaviour of alternative reinforcement, and that will meet or exceed the intended service life of a given bridge structure.</abstract>

    <abstract>The poor current condition and continued deterioration of transportation assets, including bridges and other structures, is a well-documented concern in the United States (ASCE 2017). State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are challenged with the need to improve (or at least maintain) the condition of large networks of assets with inadequate budgets. Inspection is an important part of the asset management process that provides the information upon which maintenance and repair decisions are made. This proposal focuses on the specific issues associated with bridges, but the framework is anticipated to have applications to other types of infrastructure. For the past several decades, U.S. bridge inspection practices have been based on a model that requires most bridges be inspected on a fixed two-year cycle, and where the vast majority of inspections are conducted visually. There is a growing recognition that bridge inspection practices are in need of enhancement in order to provide for public safety and the most effective use of maintenance and repair budgets (ASCE/SEI-AASHTO Ad Hoc Group, 2009). For example, recent research has studied the development of risk based inspection practices that seek to extend inspection periods for low risk bridges and focus inspection efforts on the most critical elements (Washer et. al., 2014). A significant body of research has also investigated the application of a variety of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to bridge inspection (particularly bridge decks) (Gucunski, et.al. 2013). The potential of NDE methods beyond visual inspection to enhance the understanding of bridge condition has been demonstrated; but challenges remain in the effective utilization of NDE by DOTs. One significant limitation is the difficulty in interpretation of collected data that limits the accuracy of NDE techniques. For example, recent analysis of commercially conducted NDE bridge deck scans on four Colorado bridges showed that the scanned results often did a poor job of identifying areas on bridge decks in need of repair and in estimating the level of repair needed (Vemuri and Atadero, 2016). Another issue limiting the application of NDE (beyond visual inspection) by state transportation agencies is the cost. States currently have well established practices by which they conduct and pay for routine visual inspections. Introducing other NDE methods as routine is challenging because they are not yet in a position to replace visual inspection, and thus are viewed as an additional cost that must be paid. Paying for NDE might reduce the funding available to conduct preventive maintenance or repair structures. On the other hand, NDE might be a cost savings measure if its findings are accurate enough to prevent mobilizing a large construction crew for only a limited amount of repair work, or if it ensures that repairs are conducted in a timely fashion while repair costs are still lower (i.e., the structure has not deteriorated to a poorer condition stage where the cost of repair is significantly higher). In order for transportation agencies to adjust their inspection practices to best use the capabilities of various NDE techniques beyond visual inspection, they must have confidence in the methods to inspect the bridge and an understanding of the lifecycle cost implications of NDE use. This study will focus specifically on the lifecycle cost implications of using NDE methods besides visual inspection to inspect bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Highway Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures (HSCOBS) of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) maintains the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications for bridges as part of its responsibility to design and manage the nation�s highway infrastructure.
 
The LRFD Specifications contain requirements for design of interface shear applications. In the fourth edition with 2008 interim revisions, a stress limit of reinforcement was added to keep the rebar stress from exceeding 60 ksi in calculating interface shear capacity, even if rebar with a strength greater than 60 ksi is used. The stress limit was based on a small number of laboratory tests. This could result in overly conservative estimates of interface shear capacity.
 
Moreover, it would be wise to revisit the current interface shear design provisions. Investigation is necessary for contemporary concrete strength, surface preparation methods, shear key shape, interface locations and orientations (horizontal and vertical), mechanics of failure along the joint, and reinforcement distribution across the shear interface. Different equations may be appropriate for different interface locations: joints between top of precast girder flanges and cast-in-place bridge deck; cold joints between cast-in-place girders and cast-in-place decks; vertical cast-in-place connections between spliced precast girders; and connections of flanges and webs of box girder bridges in both orientations. The distribution of reinforcement across the shear interface may currently be over- or under-designed.
 
Revising the current design equations and construction details has the potential to provide a number of benefits: less congestion of reinforcement cages resulting in better concrete quality, reduced shipping costs, reduced construction costs, faster construction, and improved structural performance of interface shear connections.
 
The objective of this project is to propose revisions to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications related to the interface shear design capacity equations and construction details including the stress limit to be applicable for currently available rebar grades up to 100 ksi. This revision will improve interface shear design and construction details for bridges and fully utilize any additional capacity of high strength bars.</abstract>

    <abstract>To ensure or extend the service life of bridges, departments of transportation (DOTs) in every state are seeking efficient maintenance/repair strategies for aging bridges. In particular, the bridge deck is a critical component for the bridge operational safety, and it experiences the most deterioration over time compared to other bridge components. The deterioration of bridge decks can be caused by various factors, such as poor construction quality, corrosion of reinforcement, chemical or biological attacks, freeze and thaw cycles, and accidents resulting in poor skid resistance, poor ride quality, inadequate drainage, and even deteriorating structural reliability. 

The current Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) practice for bridge deck repair is specified in ODOT Construction Administration Manual of Procedures (MOP) and Construction and Material Specifications (CMS). Based on the deck defect condition, various repairs are recommended. Overall, those repairs (for cases where removal of the entire deck and replacement is not economical) can be classified as one of three types: (1) treating the concrete, (2) patch repair and (3) overlay.

The goal of this study is to review ODOT's current maintenance and repair strategies and discover new ones that can result in an operation time reduction, cost savings, an increase in life cycle and safety for the traveling public.  This research will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 mainly involves an in-depth analysis of current processes adopted by ODOT and other state DOTs, and Phase 2 involves field implementation and evaluation of the recommended solutions. Phase 2 is contingent upon the successful completion of Phase 1 and the written authorization of the ODOT Research Section.

    <abstract>Prestressed concrete C-channels and cored slabs, and steel beams of various shapes and forms make up a significant percentage of the common bridge superstructure systems used by North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). Many such bridges are in varying states of distress and require retrofit to extend their useful service life prior to major rehabilitation or superstructure replacement. The challenge is to develop retrofit techniques that are durable, easy to install, monitor and maintain, and that may be applied to the range of prestressed concrete and steel beam types. Critically, NCDOT must also be able to rate the proposed retrofit using approved American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHTO) methods before it may be applied in the field. In many cases the retrofit may be considered temporary since the bridge may be scheduled for replacement in the near future. Temporary strengthening is intended to provide the ability to maintain a sufficiently high operating rating to keep the bridge functional while replacement is scheduled. In lieu of an acceptable retrofit, the bridge may need to be load posted or closed, often resulting in significant detours and disruption. Previous collaboration with NCDOT (TA-2014-05) demonstrated analytically that mechanically-fastened (MF) carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates may be used to restore the ultimate flexural capacity of deteriorated prestressed C-channel beams. The use of mechanical fasteners eliminates the need for an epoxy adhesive bond typical of common FRP strengthening systems, which means that the MF-CFRP strengthening system is effective immediately upon installation, and simplifies the installation, field inspection and monitoring of the strengthening system.  The shortcoming of the existing system is that it does not increase the cracking moment resistance of the strengthened prestressed concrete beam and hence, the operating rating remains unchanged and the strengthening technique is not approved for use in the field.  It is hypothesized that a similar mechanically fastened strengthening system could be applied to damaged or deficient steel girders, and that rating steel girders might be less complicated since there is no "cracking moment" to consider in load rating. Two effective alternatives, which form the basis for this research project, are available to address the current inability to increase the operating rating using the otherwise desirable MF-CFRP system which include: (i) the ability to prestress the MF-CFRP plate during the installation process which will have the effect of closing existing flexural cracks and increasing the cracking moment by effectively inducing a camber in the existing beam in the same way that internal steel prestressing does - the same may be achieved by propping the beam prior to installing the MF-CFRP; and (ii) the development of software analysis tools for use by NCDOT load rating engineers that will enable a complete sectional analysis of a (strengthened) prestressed concrete beam for any generic cross-section, which has proven to be a limitation of existing software tools used by the NCDOT. It is the development of these two tools, which were not recognized prior to NCDOT Technical Assistance No. TA-2014-05 and hence, was beyond the original scope of work, that will finally enable the use of FRP strengthening systems by NCDOT. Research products will include: State-of-the-practice reference document; guidelines and specifications covering the analysis, design, installation and field inspection of MF-CFRP retrofitted beams; a complete solution to extend the service life of deteriorated prestressed concrete and steel beams using a durable FRP strengthening system considering both operational load rating and flexural capacity; a cost benefit analysis of the proposed MF-CFRP retrofit technique; and a user-friendly analysis tool to facilitate load rating calculations for any prestressed concrete and steel beam sections.</abstract>

    <abstract>Existing, drilled shaft or caisson designs require large diameters rendering this design option economically unattractive, while timber piles have the drawbacks of lower load capacity (due to the structural material properties and smaller cross section diameter) and shorter service life due to durability issues within marine environments.  Alternative foundation systems for traffic signal structures, such as open pipe piles, with or without torsion fins, can offer a cost-effective solution suitable for the demanding geotechnical and loading conditions of NC coastal environments, while also minimizing the footprint of the foundation to optimize right of way costs. The recommendation to investigate the feasibility of using open-ended driven steel pipe piles is based in part on the positive reviews in the recent 2015 National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 478 report, which indicates that this deep foundation type is becoming popular amongst many US Departments of Transportation (DOTs) as an alternative to drilled shafts or pile groups due to the high load capacity potential, cost competitiveness, and constructability, especially in coastal environments.  
The proposed study will conduct a comprehensive review of the national and international state of practice of foundation systems being considered for traffic and sign structures that are subject to high and complex loading demand coupled with poor foundation soil conditions.  Based on this synthesis study we will select the most promising and cost-effective foundation system for detailed investigation as a possible foundation system for traffic and sign structures in coastal NC. Thus the identification of a viable, more economical foundation systems for these highway structures is the main goal of the project.  A list of specific objectives proposed for this project include the following: (1) Detailed literature review and detailed survey of the state of current practice followed by other U.S. DOTs facing similar challenges e.g., high loading demand and poor foundation conditions); (2) Design and implement a detailed experimental program to be carried out under controlled conditions at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Charlotte geotechnical test pit to investigate the selected several configurations (loading, soil conditions, and geometries) of the selected foundation system; (3) Develop, validate, and calibrate 3D finite element (FE) models based on the proposed experimental program to be carried out under controlled conditions; (4) Carry out a parametric analyses using the validated and calibrated 3D FE model to assess the influence of key variables and conditions expected in NCDOT projects in the coastal region; (5) Develop design procedures, and design aids to be used by NCDOT personnel from the IT&amp; Signal unit and the other units (e.g., unit dealing with general highway signs); and (6) Develop a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design of the selected foundation system.

    <abstract>Retaining walls constructed from top-down (�cut� walls) are utilized on numerous transportation projects. Design of these walls involves estimation of lateral earth pressure distribution to evaluate safety against soil failure at the strength limit state, as well as movement and stability at the service limit state. Various methods are currently used to predict the loads acting on the wall elements as well as to estimate wall movement. These methods can produce varied results. The over prediction of lateral earth pressure and wall movement results in conservative design which may correlate to unnecessarily high retaining wall cost. On the contrary, underestimation of lateral earth pressure and wall movement may result in wall failure or excessive wall deflection and/or settlement behind the wall. Furthermore, there is little documentation regarding actual versus predicted lateral earth pressures or wall movements for cut walls, particularly for those built in Wisconsin. Better estimation of earth pressures will provide calibration of commonly used design procedures and a reduction in retaining wall cost and improvement in performance.
This study will meet the following objectives: (1) Investigate the short-term and long-term performance of cut retaining walls, namely soldier pile and lagging walls since they are most commonly built by Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). (2) Measure the top-of-wall lateral deflection of cut retaining walls. (3) Measure the magnitude and distribution of lateral earth pressure along the height of the wall. (4) Measure vertical ground settlement at various points behind the wall. (5) Compare measured lateral earth pressure and retaining wall movement versus estimated wall movements generated from commonly used methods and computer programs. (6) Determine if modifications to existing design methodologies can be made based on findings of research. </abstract>

    <abstract>Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT)  county maintenance forces are responsible for removing unsound concrete (spalling) on parapet walls and deck edges from bridges over traffic. The work entails setting up extensive traffic control zones followed by removing the unsound concrete with small pneumatic jack hammers.  Once the unsound concrete has been removed a new surface area has been created that is left unprotected from the deicing materials used during the snow and ice season.

The purpose of this research is to determine if there is a better way to remove the unsound concrete in lieu of pneumatic tools, the extent of removing unsound concrete before jeopardizing the safety of the bridge, and the best method to seal/protect the newly exposed concrete surface to prevent further deterioration.  Phase 1 of this research conducted an in depth analysis of ODOT's current process for repairing spalling on bridge parapets and deck edges and provided recommendations on how to improve safety, production and cost effectiveness. Phase 2 is to determine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of implementing the recommendations from Phase 1.        </abstract>

    <abstract>Tunnels are typically one of the most critical links in a transportation network and will greatly undermine network resilience when they lose functionality (either entirely or partially) due to hazardous loading conditions. In this project, the research team proposes to develop a database and software platform for tunnel function loss management, a reliability-based framework to quantitatively assess tunnel functionality loss under variety of loading environments (including ordinary deterioration over time, earthquakes, wave surge, and man-made hazards), and a method to integrate this information into regional transportation network functionality. This will be done through collaboration with local department of transportation (DOT) engineers and collaboration with an NIST-funded Center for Risk-based Community Resilience Planning. The principal investigators (PIs) will also develop a tunnel reliability module in a graduate level reliability classes for education of graduate students.</abstract>

    <abstract>Corrosion is the main reason for costly maintenance of aging transportation infrastructure in the U.S. Since 2008, the principal investigator's (PI�s) group has developed long period fiber grating (LPFG) sensors for point strain and steel mass loss measurements. When attached on a steel bar, a LPFG sensor doped with nano iron/silica particles and polyurethane can monitor the corrosion process of steel. However, the coating of particles with polyurethane was not robust. In addition, chloride concentration is important for the prediction of early corrosion in practice. Compared to grating sensors, Brillouin scattering based sensors have lower spatial resolution but offer a cost-effective solution to the monitoring of large-scale civil infrastructure. Therefore, integrating LPFG sensors into a distributed sensing system for multiple parameter measurements is important in bridge applications. Unlike fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors that have been recently applied to civil infrastructure, LPFG sensors and distributed sensing systems are still tested in laboratory. Their packaging is critical in field applications. An LPFG sensor is an in-line fiber device with its core refractive index changing periodically in the range of 100 &#x3BC;m to 1 mm for strain and corrosion monitoring, respectively. The gratings couple light energy between the core/guided mode and the cladding/lossy modes. This coupling condition is sensitive to the strain applied to the fiber, temperature and refractive index of surrounding medium (e.g. corrosion effect). Changes in these parameters can result in significant shifting of an attenuation band and resonant wavelength. Changes in strain and temperature also vary the density of the fiber and thus stimulate Brillouin scattering in pulse pre-pump Brillouin optical time domain analysis (PPP-BOTDA). With both LPFG and PPP-BOTDA measurements, strain and temperature at the location of gratings could be discriminated simultaneously. This project aims to: (1) Develop a physically and optically protected LPFG strain sensor that is hermetically packaged in a fused silica capillary tube, (2) Develop a Fe-C coated LPFG sensor for life-cycle corrosion monitoring (chloride ion and mass loss) of nearby steel members, (3) Understand how many LPFG sensors of different types and wavelengths can be multiplexed to measure multiple parameters for the monitoring of large-scale bridges, and (4) Understand potential interference between the LPFG sensor interrogation and the PPP-BOTDA measurement. To date, the focus of this project will be to characterize the sensitivity of wavelength change to the chloride concentration in corrosive environment and the mass loss of a Fe-C coated LPFG sensor and to apply the Fe-C coated sensor into the establishment of a life-cycle deterioration model of reinforced concrete (RC) and steel members in 3.5% NaCl solution. To enable chloride and mass loss measurement, transmission spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of a series of LPFG sensors will be obtained simultaneously so that wavelength-mass relation and sensor repeatability can be studied.

    <abstract>The 2001 study sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) raised serious concern on the consistency and reliability of visual inspection. Although consistent ratings can be obtained with a good quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program, based on a recent study by the principal investigator (PI), the concern for reliability of defect detection remains. With the adoption of the recent American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual for Bridge Element Inspection, the new inspection approach not only requires rating for bridge elements, but also the location and extent of deterioration. Since autonomous robotic systems generate an enormous amount of inspection data, deducing from the data to a simple rating along with the location and extent of deterioration is a significant challenge. For example, RABIT�� has been used to inspect concrete bridge decks with six devices, including ground penetrating radar (GPR), impact-echo and ultrasonic surface wave. However, the probability of detection (POD) for damage has not been fully demonstrated to be significantly improved using multiple devices. Data fusion will be used to derive a rating from test data from multiple nondestructive evaluation (NDE) devices and visual inspections in two steps. First, location and extent of deterioration, such as delamination, will be determined by fusing data from NDE devices. Currently, almost all data fusion techniques are based on the measurement outputs of multiple devices. In this study, the wave-structure interaction leading to the measurement outcomes will be taken into account in data fusion, potentially resulting in more consistent identification of deterioration. Second, once identified reliably, damage data and visual inspection findings can be fused to determine a rating through algorithms such as artificial neural network and Fuzzy logic, while minimizing false positives and particularly false negatives. Training data for the algorithms will come from existing experience on the type and extent of deterioration and damage through inspection reports and experience of inspectors (e.g. 21 bridge inspection teams that the PI has worked with during the recent study). This project aims to develop new fusion strategies of data collected from multiple NDE devices for improved POD based on further understanding and modeling of damage detection mechanisms, and to develop algorithms for the derivation of bridge ratings from identified damage and visual inspection findings. The focus of the first year will be to: (1) Develop a framework of quantitative bridge inspection using relevant data from the literature and those derived from NDE devices, (2) Identify potential NDE devices for different bridge elements, (3) Characterize POD and its improvement through data fusion.

    <abstract>The Inspecting and Preserving Infrastructure through Robotic Exploration (INSPIRE) center will apply mobile sensors, robots, and UAVs in bridge inspection to improve quality of inspection data and reduce time and cost. Full use and benefit of these technologies demands the re-invention of programs for bridge inspection. It is not sufficient to graft new technologies onto existing inspection programs. A new inspection program will be proposed with the following considerations: (1) Visual inspection by a human inspector is low-tech, but complex. An inspector makes multiple, diverse decisions to identify, evaluate, and record conditions during inspections. The inspector cannot be automated. Instead, clearly defined constituent tasks in observation or detection could aid the inspector.  (2) Constituent tasks cost less if tasks are repeated with little or no change at many bridge elements and at many bridges. Inspections can be organized by task, a single task at many bridges in one deployment, which differs from the current organization by bridge, many tasks at a single bridge in one deployment. (3) Inspections can be made incremental with knowledgeable crews for various tasks. Separate crews complete separate tasks at separate times. But conditions and defects are mapped in standardized reports of inspections. Spatial distribution and correlation of conditions among elements will help understand and remedy the causes of deterioration. (4) A data system is needed to track the dates and methods of all constituent tasks together with the bridge elements and portions of elements completed. The data system aids in efficient organization of inspection activities, and in assurance that each bridge is completely inspected every two years. (5) All constituent inspection reports at each bridge are periodically reviewed to make a comprehensive evaluation of safety, which is the intent of Federal regulations for bridge inspection programs. National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) Team Leaders will have new authority to select, schedule, accept, and review constituent inspections, and then make evaluations of safety. Evaluations will include a field visit to each bridge to verify the remaining uncertain or ambiguous findings of constituent inspections. This project aims to develop and demonstrate a new cost-efficient, risk-based program of inspection of highway bridges. The new program employs spatial reporting of conditions, risk-based inspection intervals, incremental execution of inspections as constituent tasks, and automation of inspection tasks. It matches inspection methods to intended uses of inspection data with a comprehensive organization to monitor performance of bridges, to identify emerging risks, and to support planning of preservation actions for bridges. The focus of the first year will be on spatial reporting for bridge inspections. Standards and case studies of spatial reporting of bridge inspections will be produced. Spatial reporting captures the locations of all conditions and defects found during inspection. Existing methods of inspection will be adapted to map-based reporting. Maps are broadly defined to include schematic plans of bridges and the use of photo overlays to record locations of defects. Both paper- and computer-based reporting methods will be addressed.

    <abstract>Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been attracting more and more interest in the bridge engineering community over the past decade due to its excellent strength, ductility, and durability. However, the high material costs associated with UHPC have prevented it from completely replacing more conventional concrete mix designs.
Recently, a Chinese research team successfully developed a unique and innovative but low-cost geopolymer-based UHPC formula design: G-UHPC. In this formula, geopolymer composites are used to replace the cement found in traditional UHPC. By using geopolymer materials, it is not only cost effective but also environmentally friendly.
G-UHPC was originally developed for applications in protective structures, and research conducted so far has mainly focused on its blast-resistant properties. In the proposed research, more complete material tests following the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM_ International and/or American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards are to more fully evaluate the material properties. Specifically, the compression, tension, bending strength, and modulus of elasticity will be tested as well as permeability, bond strength, and followability. After the material properties are evaluated with code-based laboratory tests, a bridge concept that makes economical use of the unique characteristics of the material will be developed.
It is anticipated that after successful evaluation of the important material properties, the cost-effective and environmentally-friendly G-UHPC may be a very attractive option for future bridge construction and repair. If successful, this work will reduce overall bridge life-cycle costs by both taking advantage of its higher strength and very low (close to zero) permeability, which could essentially eliminate deterioration. Reducing cost is essential for maintaining a state of good repair when budgets are severely limited.
It is also expected that the success of this project would lead to a series of future collaborative research and funding opportunities through federal, state, and local agencies and academia organizations both nationally and internationally.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge preservation activities have focused on the service life extension of bridge components or protection systems that extend the useful life of bridges. National efforts are underway to look at materials, design and construction practices to extend the useful life of bridges toward an elusive 100 year mark. Informal research done by the Transportation Research Board Bridge Preservation Committee (AHD037) using 20 years of National Bridge Inventory data for all states in the United States indicates that the majority of bridge replacements may not be driven by the condition of the bridge. If the majority of bridges are not being replaced due to condition, then what is driving bridges to be taken out of service? Are bridge preservation efforts appropriately focused on the true factors that are leading to the premature replacement of bridges? Understanding what is causing bridges to be decommissioned will allow bridge managers to better adapt practices to achieve the maximum possible service life. The objective of this research project is to determine the driving causes of bridge decommissioning in the United States.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) legislation established national goals for infrastructure condition, congestion reduction, and environmental sustainability and reduced project delivery delays. In 2015, these goals were carried forward in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). 
Bridge Maintenance and Preservation activities that minimize environmental impacts can have positive impacts on these national goals:
(1) Infrastructure condition - Timely coating system and joint seal maintenance can extend bridge life and prevent the deposition of hazardous paint and other materials into waterways. 
(2) Congestion reduction - Bridge deck maintenance on bridges in fair condition can reduce traffic noise, speed change cycles, and truck detours. Timely preservation work may also reduce work zone disruptions and other negative aspects of bridge operations and life cycle. 
(3) Environmental sustainability - Reduced material and energy needs may result from extended bridge life and reduce the need for more significant impacts associated with bridge replacement. 
(4) Reduced project delivery delays � Activities, which minimize environmental impacts can reduce the time required to obtain environmental documents and permits. 
The objective of this project was to identify effective practices and provide the information needed to develop guidelines to assist bridge owners in selecting the most appropriate strategies and procedures for bridge maintenance and preservation activities in order to minimize environmental impacts. </abstract>

    <abstract>The most common type of bridge on South Dakota (SD) local roads is double-tee (DT) prestressed girders. More than 700 DT bridges are currently in-service in SD. Structural detailing, aging, traffic volume, and environmental conditions such as a high number of freezethaw cycles and use of de-icing agents may significantly affect the structural performance, integrity, and capacity of bridges. These factors are critical for DT bridges located in SD since (1) more than 75% of SD DT bridges are 20 years or older, (2) a recent study by Wehbe et al. (2016) showed that the typical DT girder longitudinal joint detailing is not adequate for longterm performance, and (3) there are more than 100 freeze-thaw annual cycles in SD on average (Haley, 2011), which may expedite the deterioration of this type of bridges. When a bridge is affected by one or more of these parameters, the evaluation and rating of load carrying capacity of the bridge is necessary to ensure the safety of the traveling public and to prevent excessive bridge damage and collapse. Load rating of a bridge requires reliable estimation of actual capacities of the affected members as well as the knowledge of live load distribution and demands. Due to a lack of specific load rating for South Dakota double-tee bridges, the "posting" of these type of bridges is challenging.

This proposed project will develop a guideline to accurately load rate DT bridges located in South Dakota. To achieve this objective, both field and laboratory testing are recommended. Field tests will provide sufficient information to understand the live load distribution and dynamic load allowance specific to DT. The laboratory testing of full-scale salvaged DT girders will provide information to accurately calculate the actual capacity of deteriorated bridges. A load rating guideline based on visual identification of damage in DT bridges will be developed to further help engineers to rate those bridges in a timely and accurate fashion.</abstract>

    <abstract>As truck weights and volumes increase and the bridge infrastructure ages, owners have a vital need to access quality truck and load performance data for bridge management and operations decision-making purposes.  The objective of this study is to assess the effect of truck traffic on bridge performance.  This multi-year study will collect quality truck traffic and loads data (volumes, classifications, size, weights, and other relevant data) by installing, maintaining, calibrating, and utilizing instrumentation at selected bridge sites nationally, for the purpose of calibrating bridge specifications and quantifying load-induced deterioration of bridge elements and systems to establish bridge performance and serviceability criteria for improved long-term bridge performance, management and operations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Prestressed concrete girders can be vulnerable to damage. The top flanges of girders can be damaged during the deck removal process of deck replacement projects. Prestressed girders can be damaged by vehicle impacts to the bottom flanges. 

Prompt, well-informed decisions need to be made when pre-stressed girders are damaged. These decisions may have a significant impact on safety, roadway operations and financial budgets. When assessing damage, the following concerns may be evaluated: (1) closure of roadways (2) emergency removal of a girder; (3) remaining structural capacity and strength of the bridge; (4) durability and expected long-term performance of repairs; and (5) replacement of the entire bridge.
Often, decisions are based on experience and approximate methods of analysis; but, evaluations should also consider: (1) operational factors, such as girder stresses and deflections, and how they effect a repair; (2) actual load distribution and function of a girder/bridge system; (3) ;oad paths for movement and shear forces that may no longer be as designed; and (4) potential complexity and uncertainty of secondary load paths. 

The research for this study will include: (1) literature review and assessment of current practices in other state departments of transportation (DOTs); (2) field review and evaluation of case studies of damaged girders to quantify the nature of the damage; (3) 
analysis of the girder/bridge systems to determine the structural load distribution mechanisms; (4) review of current industry repair methods; and (5) review of past damaged girder repair to determine performance. 
This study will develop recommendations and guidelines for the inspection, evaluation, and repair (or other safety and operational responses) of damaged girders. Recommendations will be offered for the most common type and extent of damage encountered in Wisconsin for use by field inspection staff, bridge structural engineers, and contractors.

    <abstract>Consistent efforts with dense sensor deployment and data gathering processes for bridge big data have accumulated profound information regarding bridge performance, associated environments, and traffic flows. However, direct applications of bridge big data to long-term decision-making processes are hampered by big data-related challenges, including the immense size and volume of datasets, too many variables, heterogeneous data types, and, most importantly, missing data. The objective of this project was to develop a foundational computational framework that can facilitate data collection, data squashing, data merging, data curing, and, ultimately, data prediction. By using the framework, practitioners and researchers can learn from past data, predict various information regarding long-term bridge performance, and conduct data-driven efficient planning for bridge management and improvement.

This research project developed and validated several computational tools for the aforementioned objectives. The programs include (1) a data-squashing tool that can shrink years-long bridge strain sensor data to manageable datasets, (2) a data-merging tool that can synchronize bridge strain sensor data and traffic flow sensor data, (3) a data-curing framework that can fill in arbitrarily missing data with statistically reliable values, and (4) a data-prediction tool that can accurately predict bridge and traffic data. In tandem, this project performed a foundational investigation into dense surface sensors, which will serve as a new data source in the near future. The resultant hybrid datasets, detailed manuals, and examples of all programs have been developed and are shared via web folders.

The conclusion from this research was that the developed framework will serve practitioners and researchers as a powerful tool for making big data-driven predictions regarding the long-term behavior of bridges and relevant traffic information.</abstract>

    <abstract>While the use of integral and semi-integral bridge abutments has reportedly been increasing nationwide, their construction in Texas has remained limited. These systems have been reported to minimize the costs associated with the installation, maintenance, and repair of bridge deck joints and bearings. In addition, they have the potential to minimize the "bump at the end of the bridge,� which results in reduced maintenance costs. Although this technology has not been widely adopted in Texas, a reassessment of its potential cost and performance benefits is timely. This requires assessment of key design and construction aspects, including the characteristics of common soils in Texas, the details typically adopted for foundation, superstructure, and substructure, and the local pavement standards. Accordingly, this project proposes to assess the use of this technology in Texas by producing: (1) a review of US and international practices, as well as of existing data, to assess the applicability to conditions prevailing in Texas, (2) a thorough evaluation of structures already constructed in Texas, as well as of an integral bridge that will be constructed in 2016 in Texas by FHWA Federal Lands, and (3) a set of design details for using this technology in Texas conditions.</abstract>

    <abstract>While there is consensus among stakeholders (Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), State department of Transportation's (DOT's), Academia, Industry) that better data on bridge performance is required, there is limited infrastructure in place to make the best possible use of the data. This is a considerable threat to the success and existence of the shift towards data-driven approaches. Data without a plan for extracting value quickly becomes a burden. One technique commonly used for deterioration modeling is to use non physics-based models to predict performance based on existing data. Each empirical model form (e.g., Markov chain, Artificial Neural Networks, etc.) comes with a particular set of strengths, weaknesses, biases and assumptions. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus on the best applications of model forms, or even a framework to select and use models. Beyond that, the complexity of influences on bridge performance make it very difficult to identify causal relationships between observable behavior and driving factors.

 

 The primary goal of this research is to establish a robust, flexible framework for integrating quantitative data collected from operating structures to provide reliable performance assessments and forecast remaining service life (i.e., descriptive relationships) for structures. This research will address the problem of model selection for bridge performance data through a multiple model framework that accounts for various model approaches, as opposed to excluding them. Over time, the proposed framework may be a viable approach for identifying causal relationships of bridge attributes and inputs to bridge performance.

 

 The proposed research will achieve the stated goal through investigating varying parameter sets within a given model form, as well as multiple model forms, and looking at the ability of the model(s) to predict bridge performance. This will help to address the gap between what is observable (i.e., condition, nondestructive evaluation, member actions, global movements, etc) and what is desired (i.e., capacity, remaining service life, etc). Each model or set of models will be updated based on the observations using a Bayesian model updating approach. For multiple model forms, a set of mathematical rules must be implemented to move between model forms. The process will implicitly weigh model forms and parameter sets that are better predictors of the observed responses. From this population of multiple models, unobservable characteristics (like estimates of remaining service life) can be predicted in a probabilistic sense.</abstract>

    <abstract>In procurement requirements for design-build contracts, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) may implement a 100 year service life requirement for bridge structures. However, there are no indicated measures for how this can be achieved. In addition, for design-bid-build and design-build projects, TxDOT and consultants use TxDOT recommendations for durability to improve service performance. But no quantitative methods or codified guidance is available to demonstrate how the enhanced service life requirements are met. Moreover, because of the large number of existing old bridges, the evaluation of the remaining service life of these bridges is a very important economic problem for TxDOT. As the replacement of all these bridges far exceed the available financial resources, it is important to prioritize the repair works based on the estimated remaining service life. Consequently, this study will conduct a thorough review of the state-of-the-art and state-of practice of bridge service life prediction. The researchers will gather and analyze information related to topic areas including bridge condition inspection, deterioration modeling, and service life prediction. More specifically, they will (1) identify methods to predict service life of bridges over 75 years; (2) identify criteria for evaluating service life of newly constructed design-build and design-bid-build bridges; (3) identify appropriate tests and inspections for determining remaining service life when a bridge is turned back to the owner.</abstract>

    <abstract>Structural strengthening of deteriorated concrete bridges using advanced composite materials
such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) has gained significant attention from the
infrastructure engineering community. CFRP may be bonded along the tensile substrate of a
concrete member with an epoxy adhesive to upgrade the load-carrying capacity of the member.
Numerous advantages are expected when a structural member is retrofitted with CFRP sheets;
for instance, insignificant increase in dead load, high-strength and favorable modulus, resistance
to corrosion and fatigue, and reduced maintenance costs.
Although CFRP-strengthening has been broadly used for buildings and bridges over the last
decade, it is recognized that premature bond failure is a critical concern, which would
substantially reduce the efficacy of structural strengthening. A number of research projects were
conducted to understand the bond failure mechanism of CFRP-strengthened concrete beams and
to propose enhanced implementation methods (Bank 2006). The current state-of-the-art of
debonding-control includes use of anchorage that can retard the failure of CFRP-concrete
interface (Kalfat et al. 2013). Various types of anchor systems were suggested previously such as
mechanical anchors (Ortega 2007), non-mechanical anchors (Kim et al. 2008), and CFRP Uwraps
(Pham and Al-Mahaidi 2006). These approaches, however, are not a permanent solution
because i) mechanical anchors are susceptible to corrosion that can cause secondary distress to the
bonded CFRP; ii) non-metallic anchors need extra endeavors and will eventually fail when
excessive mechanical stresses are associated; and iii) CFRP U-wraps can also debond from the
concrete. An intrinsically different approach is essential to address the critical debonding
problem in externally-bonded CFRP application.
A holistic research program integrating experimental and theoretical investigations is proposed to
develop an innovative debonding-control method for CFRP-strengthened concrete members
without using external anchorage. Unlike conventional strengthening approaches employing
CFRP sheets bonded to the surface of concrete, the novel idea is that wide grooves are cut near
both ends of a concrete member and CFRP sheets are embedded so that stress concentrations 
2
causing end-peeling failure are mitigated. It is important to note that this approach is different
from existing near-surface-mounted (NSM) application that requires long grooves for CFRP
strips. A grouting agent made of polyester-silica will be used to fill the gap between the embedded
CFRP and the concrete substrate. The polyester-silica resin is believed to be a strong candidate providing
sufficient bond to the CFRP-concrete interface. The proposed concept for debonding-control of
externally bonded CFRP sheets has not been exploited by others previously and thus will
advance the state-of-the-art of rehabilitation technologies.</abstract>

    <abstract>In the recently completed U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Study, Review of U.S. Department of Transportation Truck Size and Weight Study (USDOT TS&amp;W Study), a small number of bridges in relation to the total population of bridges were evaluated for force effects and the associated cost to strengthen or replace them due to the increased weight of the new legal truck configurations and gross weights. A broader study of the force effects, such as increased demand on girders and deck, reduction in service life, and remaining fatigue life, on the total population of bridges in the United States would be beneficial to understand and predict more accurate cost effects of increasing legal loads. More generally, the Highway Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures needs a roadmap that acknowledges ongoing and complete truck-size-weight-cost studies related to bridge condition and provides the logical next steps. At the minimum, the parametric study should compare the force effects (moments and shears) of standard AASHTO bridge design trucks (HS-20, HS-15, H-20, H-15 and HL-93) over a full range of span lengths (20� to 250�) for both simply supported and continuous structures to the six trucks evaluated in the USDOT TS&amp;W study. The objectives of this research were to (1) conduct a parametric study to assess the impact of increasing legal loads on highway bridges, including local and currently posted bridges, on the cost of bridge replacement per state; (2) prepare a roadmap of study items and actions necessary to make the true cost effects of increasing legal loads known by decision makers.</abstract>

    <abstract>As a national trend, Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are faced with difficult financial decisions. The age of the
infrastructure is increasing and deteriorating, needing maintenance and in some cases
replacement. This does not include the additional needs of infrastructure expansion due to the
population increasing. However, there simply is not enough money available to meet the
required needs. As a result, judicious decisions need to be made based on accurate assessment of
bridge performance.
Bridge performance is dependent on many factors and therefore is often different than the
assumed designed behavior. Factors such as prestress losses, loading frequency and magnitude,
load distribution, support conditions and environment are critical variables that can lead to
changes in bridge performance.
The appropriateness of applying current design methods to calculate prestress losses
needs to be evaluated. For example, elastic shortening and creep are two major components of
the total prestress loss. With higher strength concretes available today, girders will almost
certainly be more highly stressed than one made with conventional concrete, the magnitude of
those loss components will probably increase. It is unknown whether this difference in prestress
loss is adequately taken into account by present methods of analysis. In response to these
concerns, several research projects have been performed in order to quantify the response of
prestress concrete girder bridges fabricated with high performance concrete. Ahlborn et al.
(1995) compared the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) design provisions with the measured response of two
long-span, high-strength composite prestressed bridge girders. They found that the design
specifications overestimated the high-strength concrete modulus of elasticity resulting in under
predicted elastic shortening losses and over predicted the creep and shrinkage losses. Roller et
al. (1995) performed an experimental investigation with four high strength concrete bridge 
girders. Two of the girders were used to evaluate the early-age flexural properties and the
remaining two were used to determine the long-term behavior. The researchers concluded that
prestress concrete girders made with high strength concrete can be expected to adequately
perform if designed according to the AASHTO Standard Specifications. Kowalsky et al. (2001)
instrumented four prestress high-performance concrete bridge girders in North Carolina. These
researchers found that the elastic shortening and creep losses were major contributors to the total
losses with shrinkage losses much less so. The larger than expected elastic shortening and creep
losses were attributed to a lower modulus of elasticity than predicted. The total prestress losses
ranged from 12.9% to 19.1% of the initial jacking stress. Other prestress loss bridge research
can be found in Shams and Kahn (2000), Lopez et al. (2003) and Waldron (2004).
This second focus of the proposed research will be to obtain the critical bridge live load
performance factors by developing a self contained, rapidly deployable data acquisition system
that can be applied to a bridge and and monitor the required data. It is proposed that this system
will be deployed on a bridge in northern Utah. The data gathered from this system will be
compared with assumed design parameters. This information can aid engineers in determining
actual bridge behavior. This information can aid in bridge maintenance and replacement
decisions.
This research will work with two leading companies, Campbell Scientific and Bridge
Diagnostic Inc. to obtain high-quality data to address these uncertainties in bridge behavior.

    <abstract>In spite of the benefits of deck girder bridge systems for prefabricated bridge elements and systems (PBES)/accelerated bridge construction (ABC), their usage has been limited to relatively short span and low traffic bridges because of their long term performance of their connections, and difficulties in accommodating super-elevation transitions on bridge decks, pier skews, differential camber, shipping, and handling stability. Skewed girders cause bridge deck profile problems because the cambers in adjacent girders do not align. The diaphragms are then difficult to connect and/or quite big forces are induced if they are used to bring the girders into line.

In order to optimize the decked bulb tee design, the longitudinal joint between flanges must have sufficient stiffness such that the same live load distribution factor can be used as for I-girder bridges with cast-in-place decks. There are a myriad of potential variables for the joint including width, bar size, bar spacing, bar detailing (straight, bent, or headed), and black or epoxy bars. The variable flange thickness (thicker near the web) will help the ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) joint, by attracting much of the total static moment due to a wheel load toward the negative moment region at the web and away from the mid-span region where the UHPC joint is located.

Research is needed to investigate design, fabrication, transportation, and construction of precast deck girder bridges. Other factors such as connections between adjacent units, longitudinal joints, live load distribution, continuity for live load, skew effects, and suitability of lightweight aggregates concrete need to be addressed by this research. The research should focus on optimizing the joint width. This project should address the constructability aspects and suggest methods of leveling the girders, how to determine the size of the leveling equipment needed, and means of holding the girders in the level position to allow the leveling equipment to be removed before the flange connections are fully cured.

The objective of this research is to implement design, fabrication, transportation, and construction algorithms and to develop suitable details for the connection for prefabricated deck girders with UHPC for PBES/ABC.

    <abstract>Corrosion is one of the most often-cited problems with steel bridges. The need for a synthesis study on this topic is immediate. Owners are replacing a large number of Interstate Era bridges and building significant numbers of new bridges and transportation structures. Now is the time to choose materials, coatings, and details wisely and develop and implement effective long term care and maintenance plans for newly constructed bridges and transportation structures. Some of these approaches work better in different parts of the country; approaches that work well in northern states where deicing salts are a significant issue may not offer much benefit in coastal states where exposure to salt water and sea air are more of a concern. Making the wisest choice among the right coating, material, details and actions while considering the environment where the bridge will be located is complicated. While there has been much research performed in each of these areas, it has generally been done in a somewhat isolated and uncoordinated fashion. There is no single comprehensive document that provides both qualitative and quantitative information on all these various approaches. A synthesis is needed to compile knowledge on the various strategies and collect effective practices presently in use. Information will be gathered by literature review and a survey of the state departments of transportation (DOTs). Topics to be studied include research and practice on the following: (1) Coatings / surface treatments: (a) paint coatings; (b) galvanization; and (c) metallization. (2) Materials: (a) weathering steel ; (b) stainless steel, including ASTM A1010; and (c) standard structural steel. (3) Actions: (a) cleaning / washing; (b) recoating ; and (c) pot repairs of coating. The study will also identify gaps in knowledge and needed research. The payoff for this research will be multifold. This work may lead to reduced initial construction costs by illuminating cost-effective approaches for achieving corrosion resistance in steel bridges. This may also lead to reduced long term, life-cycle costs by educating owners about effective maintenance and repair actions. Further, this work may lead to reduced impacts on the traveling public by delivering bridges and transportation structures that are longer lasting and easier to maintain. </abstract>

    <abstract>A major impediment for the implementation of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) in transportation infrastructure is the lack of effective references for training and technology transfer in practice, because the information is usually disparate, often confusing, and even contradictory. Therefore, this project offers the opportunity for developing a concise yet complete reference report that can serve as a �practical� educational tool, and facilitate the evaluation and implementation of externally bonded FRP repair by State Department of Transportation (DOT) personnel. An extensive review of FRP retrofit literature for highway structures will be performed. An evaluation of FRP-retrofitted projects in West Virginia will be completed. Bridge location, purpose of the FRP wrap, retrofit details and cost, cost/benefit studies, percentages of added capacities and targeted versus actual time frames for the FRP retrofit will be documented. Other advantages and disadvantages will be presented. Non-destructive testing/non-destructive examination (NDT/NDE) practices for inspecting FRP external wraps shall be developed. Of a major importance is to evaluate the acceptance levels of FRP-retrofitted projects by DOTs and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The outcomes of the completed research to evaluate the remaining service life of corrosion-deteriorated concrete bridge members based on the existing chloride content will be heavily utilized. The research team will work closely with West Virginia Division of Highways (WVDOH) and Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) members managing the databases, inventory, inspection reports, digital pictures, load ratings, load postings, remaining strength, etc. Criteria will be proposed to determine the suitability for FRP retrofit of types of structures, based on assessments for damage and inventory parameters. The project team will propose a prioritized classification process into three levels for possible candidate structures. WVDOT and VDOT candidate structures will be evaluated against these criteria. Existing reports and national guidelines/ specifications will be reviewed. The review will cover all the aspects of FRP research pertaining to repairing, reinforcing, or strengthening by external wrap and near-surface mounting. VDOT and WVDOH structural programs will be examined to check how they could account for FRP strengthening.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concrete surface resistivity, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Spec (AASHTO Spec) and bulk resistivity, are  easy to implement, non-destructive tests which can identify several important parameters, including concrete permeability and can potentially be correlated to applied tension loads, pore size distribution, alkali silica reaction, sulfate attack, internal relative humidity accurately detect setting time. This project seeks to synthesize national literature and past projects, focusing on performance metrics. Concrete mixtures and specimens from around the state of Utah, will be investigated to identify relevant phenomena using several variations of concrete constituents, including multiple aggregate types, common  supplementary cemetitious materials, w/c ratios and curing styles. All mixtures will be mixed by ready mix companies and precasters within the state of Utah. Mechanical and durability properties will be investigated, including (but not limited to) strength, elastic modulus, chloride ion permeability, freeze thaw, surface resistivity and bulk resistivity. Relationships between measured variables will be identifified and variability associated with the resistnace measurement techniques. This project will seek to estimate acceptable levels of performance metrics (i.e., concrete permeability) including the synthesized literature and past Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) projects quantifying bride deck performance metrics.</abstract>

    <abstract>Steel bridges are constructed using steel sections that consist of either rolled wide flanges or builtup
girders. Built-up girders, also known as plate girders, are made up of flanges, webs and
stiffeners, which are typically welded together. The problem with plate girders is that long-term
fatigue crack initiation can manifest at the welded details. Moreover, the webs are relatively thin,
which require the addition of transverse stiffeners to achieve the required shear capacity. The thin
webs can also corrode through fairly quickly once corrosion begins. From a maintenance
perspective, the added stiffeners to enhance the shear capacity can trap debris and moisture on the
bottom flange. This can give rise to corrosion fatigue, which is not addressed in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
Design Specifications.
On the other hand, the use of rolled beams in steel bridges can be very advantageous since the
webs are an integral part of the flanges in that the beams are rolled out of one piece of steel and
the webs are significantly thicker than built-up girder webs. Therefore, there is no need for
transverse stiffeners to enhance the shear capacity of the web. From a maintenance and
deterioration perspective, the beams have smoother lines with no stiffeners to trap moisture and
debris on the bottom flange. Despite their advantage, rolled beams are limited in sizes, which
impose constraint on their use to relatively short spans due to deflection requirements.
The newly proposed superstructure utilizes rolled beams in combination with a reinforced concrete
slab, resting on the bottom flanges of the beams, to enhance the deflection of the system and allow
for longer spans to be built using rolled beams. The added slab increases the cross-sectional
moment of inertia; thereby lowering the deflection of the whole system. The bottom slab also
significantly enhances the torsional stability of the bridge as the geometry of the bridge is
transformed to a closed-section. The enhanced torsional stability eliminates the need for crossbracing
or lateral bracings, which eradicates potential problems associated with distortion fatigue
at the web gab of connection plates. In addition, the new system will employ the concept of Simple
Made Continuous (SMC) where the connection of the spans over the pier are �simple for dead �
continuous for live� or SD-CL. Typically, continuous bridges are more economical than simple
span bridges because they develop smaller positive interior span moments due to the negative
moments at the continuous ends.

    <abstract>This project will develop a class of V-connectors for bridge deck-piers and pier-footing joints to provide seismic isolation while facilitating accelerated bridge construction and retrofit. The work is being performed in two stages. Work in Stage 1 focuses on the analysis and design of the V-connector family. The analysis involves two tasks: (i) development of a theoretical model to obtain the generalized principle of the relationship between key design parameters and the connector�s performance for seismic protection; and (ii) establishing the numerical model that is able to screen and quantify the design parameters for a regular bridge at a site with seismic parameters given by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Manual Section 3. The connectors are to be designed with the following two options: (i) work with partner state departments of transportation (DOTs) to identify at least one bridge project that could use the product and then design the connector for that particular bridge based on the theoretic model and numerical analysis developed earlier in the project; or (ii) design the connector to fit the bridge types listed by the AASHTO LRFD Manual. A set of designed connectors will be fabricated for shake-table tests. Contacts with a connector manufacturer and state DOTs will be made to discuss connector manufacturing and identify suitable bridge sites. Work in the second and final stage will involve shake-table tests and completing at least one set of connector design, based on original design and shake-table test results. The connector will be manufactured and implemented on an actual bridge under construction. Two tasks of the designated analysis have been committed: (i) a two-degree theoretical model has been established based on the one-degree model currently applied by AASHTO LRFD manual, whereby the key is to using hysteretic curve to determine the damping coefficient. It has been identified that the natural friction between the connected surface-pair provides sufficient damping for seismic isolation, which is also the unique advantage for the invented V-connector family. (ii) 3D-finite element models have been established for screening optimized design parameters with the best performance, for which the analysis of the data is on-going. A visit was made to the University of California-Berkeley laboratory to discuss and arrange for the test plan.</abstract>

    <abstract>The data that exists or can be obtained regarding the condition and behavior of our nation's infrastructure presently exceeds the profession's ability to make efficient use of said data. Existing data sets span an enormous range of relative breadth and depth. For example, the breadth of the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) is comprehensive, but relatively basic with respect to structural condition. At the opposite extreme, state of the art structural models (i.e., finite element analysis) of individual structures can be created that give accurate and detailed information on the stress and displacement profiles throughout the structure under diverse loading conditions, but are only performed on rare occasions where the level of effort involved in their creation is worthwhile. Between these two extremes is element level data recorded by owners that quantifies more precise information on the severity and extent of deteriorated conditions than the NBI. Each of these data types has been used for various applications, but there are no known studies that have attempted to systematically identify and evaluate the inter-relationships between these data types. The objective of this project is to integrate this gradient of breadth and depth that can be described by these existing methodologies using big data analysis techniques to reveal a greater understanding of the structural causes of atypical bridge deterioration. This project will focus on identifying structural characteristics leading to above- or below-average performance, after accounting for differences in climate, use, etc., by creating finite element analysis models of these outliers and big data analysis techniques to systematically evaluate potential differences in stress distributions between bridges with differing conditions despite similar environments. As a result, possible short term outcomes include guidance on more efficient inspection procedures and / or more efficient and durable structural designs.
These objectives will be achieved by first using NBI records for each structure over multiple years to assess deterioration over time.  This information will be assessed in the context of climate and environmental data, which can be approximated at each bridge site based on existing data quantified at known locations and geographic information systems (GIS) software.  There are also expected differences in deterioration due to factors traffic and age of the structure, to name a few.  Thus, state of the art big data analysis techniques will be used to reveal structures that are true outliers with respect to their condition, having either significantly better or worse condition than their peers, when considering all parameters currently known to affect long term performance.  With these outliers identified, causes for their above or below average performance will then be explored.  These causes may include structural characteristics, construction quality, or the influence of other influential parameters that have yet to be considered.  This project will focus on identifying structural characteristics by creating finite element analysis models of these outliers and a novel big data analysis technique to systematically evaluate potential differences in stress distributions between bridges with differing conditions that are otherwise similar.</abstract>

    <abstract>Over 600,000 bridges in the United States are a critical component in
the transportation network for economy and society need. Assessing
bridge conditions and timely maintenance are critical to ensure bridge
health and cost-effective decision making in preservation activities.
Successful bridge-inspection programs nationwide is an important
element of assessing bridge conditions, and ultimately extending
service life of bridges.
Bridge owners nationwide have recognized the benefits of detailed
condition assessments through the use of the raw inspection
information, expanded performance measures, and bridge
management system deterioration forecasting and evaluation, which
are covered in the 2013 new American Association State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual for Bridge Element
Inspection.
The bridge condition rating of the United States is based on the NBI data of national highway bridges. Bridge
owners and stakeholders used to assess the bridge conditions and
make decision based upon these NBI data. The vast majority of the states have already employed
element-level inspection for more than a decade based on the CoRe
guide. The 2013 new AASHTO Manual, however, is significantly
different from the former CoRe guide. As a result, the difference in
frequency of inspections, element definition, qualifications of
inspection personnel, defeat description and inspection reporting from
state to state may cause inconsistency of data collection and
ultimately affect the quality of element-level data collected under
different states to be reported to the National Bridge Inventory (NBI).
As newer bridge types become more common, demand of new 
guidelines for inspection ratings is needed to increase uniformity and
consistency of inspections.
To improve consistency in assessment of bridge element conditions
and establish accuracy levels for supporting bridge management
system deterioration forecasting and evaluation, the following
challenges must be addressed scientifically and systematically: (a)
there is a practical need for nationwide applications of high quality
element-level bridge inspection. A more comprehensive, reliable and
accurate levels for element conditions and defect types to accomodate
this need is urgent; (b) AASHTO 2013 Manual for data collection
provides criteria for element condition rating and defects description,
but without reliability-based calibration. The factors that affects the
quality and consistence of data collection can cause high variability.
Thus, reliability based indices to account for correlation between
levels of element conditions and critical factors (including inspector
qualification factor, structural importance factor, material
vulnerability factor, defect type/location factor, age factor, and
environmental factor) are necessary; and (c) Existing Manuals introduce
material distress for condition rating while overlook the assessment of
bridge element conditions that account for performance, probability
of failure and risk of failure, and thus cannot guarantee the desirable
performance. New guidelines should address these concerns.
Thus, to meet the requirements in the �Moving Ahead for Progress in
the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)� legislation and to ensure the safety
of the motoring public, a methodology for assisting bridge inspectors
and bridge owners to improve the quality of element-level bridge
inspection data and enhanced bridge management is needed.
Significant effort is required to develop the guidelines for practicing
engineers, from bridge inspectors, and inspection trainers, to local and
state Department of Transportation (DOT) bridge owners, to promote consistency in the collection of
reliable data that support bridge asset management practices. The
proposed research will address this important technical need by
characterizing quality of element-level data, generating a reliability based
correlation between levels of element conditions and critical
factors, and developing new data-driven based guidelines.</abstract>

    <abstract>The state of Texas has been plagued by various durability-related issues in recent years, including deterioration from alkali-silica reaction, delayed ettringite formation, corrosion of reinforcing steel, and volume changes (plastic shrinkage, drying shrinkage, thermal effects, etc.), just to name a few. These durability-related issues, coupled with other factors, contribute to reductions in service life (e.g., service loads and defects). For many of these problems, fly ash (primarily Class F) has been the remedy of choice; however, with changes in fly ash quality and quantity spurred by new emissions standards, there is a major concern that fly ash will not be able to fill these needs in the long term. The goal of this project is to evaluate chemical alternatives to fly ash, such as the use of chemical admixtures aimed at specifically improving concrete durability.</abstract>

    <abstract>This project focuses on the cracking of concrete beams that has been observed at most of the large precast plants in Texas in recent years. This cracking appears approximately 18-24 months after fabrication, and the exact nature of these cracks is not clearly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to use existing cracked beams to predict whether long-term durability issues will develop. The research team is uniquely equipped to conduct this project due to the expertise of its team and the ability to leverage the efforts of this project with relevant projects underway at the Center for Transportation Research (CTR). The research team shall execute a comprehensive program consisting of non-destructive evaluations and core-based tests to determine the effect of the cracks on mechanical properties and durability. The research team shall develop a novel method to evaluate the extent to which the cracks contribute to corrosion of pre-stressing strands and conduct service life modeling to estimate the effect that the cracks have on the service life of the beams. Successful completion of this project shall result in the research team providing recommendations to Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) on the likelihood of long-term material and structural problems occurring from these cracks.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this project, a bridge maintenance and preservation program was developed for the City of Columbia, Missouri. The program focuses on practical and implementable technologies and procedures that can be applied to extend the service lives of the bridges, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure safety and serviceability. Specific technologies that were considered included bridge deck flushing, fog and seal programs, and crack sealers.

The researchers analyzed the state of the practice for bridge preservation through a literature search, consultations with contacts within the preservation community, and interviews with state-level bridge owners who use these technologies. Existing and historical activities undertaken by the city were also evaluated, and current needs were assessed. An informal risk analysis was used to prioritize activities and link the identified procedures with specific structures within the city. A field survey of bridges in Columbia was completed to help identify bridge preservation needs for particular bridges. These data were summarized and used to develop an implementable procedure for short-term (12 to 24 months after program implementation), mid-term (25 to 72 months after program implementation), and long-term (73 to 120 months after program implementation) actions to extend the life of bridges and reduce maintenance costs.

Key recommendations for the program include the identification and prioritization of low-cost preventive maintenance (PM) activities such as cleaning, periodic washing of bridges, and sealing of bridge decks that are currently in good condition. The identification of condition-based preservation needs through the implementation of a bridge preservation inspection program (BPIP) and the review of maintenance notes in the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) biennial inspection reports were recommended.</abstract>

    <abstract>One of the leading causes contributing to structural deficiency in the United States Bridge Inventory is related to deterioration and durability issues with concrete bridge decks (National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), 2004). The primary factor that affects the durability of the concrete deck is cracking that provides a direct conduit for moisture and other corrosive agents to penetrate the concrete and attack the reinforcing steel. The area of the bridge where deck cracking is most predominant is in the negative moment region where the concrete is subjected to tensile stresses from girder flexure. One of the problems faced by designers is the lack of clear guidance in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Factor Design (AASHTO LRFD) Specifications on the reinforcing requirements in the concrete deck. The vague AASHTO LRFD Commentary language for continuous steel girders as well as the lack of provisions for continuous prestressed concrete girders results in a complicated situation for engineers that creates overly-conservative or unconservative conditions depending on how an engineer interprets the specification and commentary. Center for Transportation Research (CTR) shall develop comprehensive guidelines for deck reinforcing steel details in the negative moment regions of bridges utilizing precast, prestressed concrete panels (PCPs). The primary focus is on continuous prestressed concrete girder systems, however; CTR shall develop improved guidance for continuous steel girder systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>Protective coatings typically fail in localized areas of steel highway structures, such as bridges and tunnels. The failed areas normally comprise a relatively small percentage of the coated surface area. Detection and remediation of soluble salts (e.g., chlorides, sulfates, and nitrates) extends the service life of protective coatings by reducing such causes of premature coatings failure. Current test methods may not be effective in evaluating problematic soluble salt levels on or available to steel surfaces when the soluble salts are concentrated randomly (i.e., in pits). This may allow retention of high, localized concentrations that will promote premature failure in subsequently applied protective coatings. Another issue is the identification of practical, effective methods for surface preparation of existing steel surfaces to mitigate these localized �hot spots� prior to application of coatings. Investigations have shown that pressure washing, abrasive blasting, or a combination of the two are not always effective in removing soluble salt "hot spots". Effective detection and remediation of soluble salt contamination are essential to maximizing the life of structural steel protective coatings. The objectives of this research are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of existing and new methods for detecting the location, distribution, and concentration of soluble salts on or available to steel highway structures; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of existing and new remediation methods for soluble salts; (3) based on the outcomes of objectives 1 and 2, propose effective practices, specifications, or methods in AASHTO standard format for detection and remediation of soluble salts; and (4) develop training materials for the design, specification, and field application of the detection and remediation methods by steel structure owners. In this research, the term �salt� shall include those of chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and other adverse ions. The term �new� shall include improvements to existing methods.

    <abstract>As of December 2013, there were 607,751 bridges in the U.S. national bridge inventory, and 181,095 of those bridges have steel superstructures.   Fatigue cracking in steel bridge members is an issue that must be addressed in all structure maintenance programs. If a fatigue crack is allowed to grow and reach a critical length, fracture may occur with the possibility of structural failure of the member. Fatigue cracks may be caused by both in-plane and out-of-plane effects.
The vulnerability of a steel bridge superstructure to further damage depends on the loading conditions and crack locations. Immediate replacement of superstructure components with fatigue cracks is often not possible due to funding priorities, access, traffic, and environmental issues. Repair of fatigue cracking has been performed on numerous bridges.
Substantial research effort has previously been devoted to understanding the sources of fatigue-prone details and developing engineering solutions to prevent such cracking through enhanced design and construction practices. However, a significant portion of the existing bridge inventory comprises steel structures and systems that contain fatigue-cracked or fatigue-prone elements. 
Bridge Preservation and Bridge Maintenance Engineers and Practitioners would benefit from a  summary of current transportation agency and industry practices and procedures used to repair fatigue cracks in existing steel bridges, and the effectiveness of the various repair methods in mitigating further growth of existing fatigue cracks.
This project would support the performance management and research strategic focus areas of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Subcommittee on Maintenance Bridge Technical Working Group. 
The objective of this project is to develop proposed AASHTO guidelines for maintenance actions to address fatigue cracking in steel bridges. The proposed guidelines should cover as a minimum: repair procedures and detailing, and include maintenance and preservation actions to mitigate further growth of existing fatigue cracks in steel bridges. 
Task 1.  Conduct a literature review of relevant domestic and international research, guidelines, and current practices to determine the current state of knowledge on (1) fatigue cracking mechanisms in steel bridges and (2) strategies employed for repair and maintenance actions. This information shall be assembled from published and unpublished reports, contacts with academia, transportation agencies, and industry organizations. The results of this task should be summarized in a tabular form showing the detail, the repair technique, and the success. The survey should include the design stress range at the detail, the type of steel, and service life at the time of the repair.
Task 2. Conduct a survey of bridge owners and other stakeholders to collect data related to the research objective. Follow-up with participants as needed. The survey plan, including questions and participants, shall be submitted to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) for review and approval prior to distribution.
Task 3. Synthesize existing repair procedures documenting the repair practice, success of the repairs, and post repair inspection. Prepare an outline of the proposed guidelines, including discussion of the contents and intent.
Task 4. Develop a draft of proposed AASHTO guidelines with commentary for maintenance actions to address fatigue cracking in steel bridges according to the approved outline. Submit the draft of the proposed guidelines no later than 3 months after the Task 3 approval. The guidelines should provide detailed repair procedures including post repair inspection recommendations.
Task 5. Revise the draft of recommended AASHTO guidelines submitted in Task 4 according to the NCHRP project panel comments.
Task 6. Present the recommended guidelines in AASHTO standard interim-revision format to the AASHTO Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures (Technical Committees: T-14 Structural Steel Design and T-18 Bridge Management, Evaluation, and Rehabilitation) and the AASHTO Subcommittee on Maintenance (Bridge Technical Working Group).
Task 7. Submit a final report describing the entire research effort with the proposed guidelines. Following receipt of the draft final report, the remaining 2 months shall be for NCHRP review and comment and for research agency preparation of the revised final report.</abstract>

    <abstract>Deficient small bridges are a significant concern for the nation�s transportation infrastructure, so advancing the implementation of time- and money-saving technology is essential to maintaining a �state of good repair.�

Geosynthetic-reinforced soil-integrated bridge systems (GRS-IBS) technology has the potential to introduce significant time and cost savings on small bridge replacements by removing the need for driven piles. Unfamiliarity with the technical performance and construction operations has impeded implementation.

The goal of this project is to advance the implementation of the technology by evaluating the construction and early service life performance of the Rustic Road GRS-IBS, which was constructed in early 2015, in Boone County, Missouri. This detailed case study was coordinated with the results of a concurrent Midwest Transportation Center effort also focused on advancing implementation of these types of bridge systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) consisting of water, cement, large 

portion of fine and coarse aggregates, and chemical admixtures is a 

highly flowable, non-segregating concrete. SCC was initially 

developed in the 1980�s by concrete researchers at the University 

of Tokyo in Japan. SCC has significantly different characteristics 

compared to Conventional Concrete (CC). Specifically, SCC is 

normally characterized by a slump of 26 to 28 inch in diameter that 

is different from CC as shown in Figure 1. It means that SCC has its 

high flowability related to workability that enables to spread into 

highly dense reinforcement areas under its self-weight and to fill any 

small voids without mechanical vibration. As a result of the high 

workability, SCC provides additional benefits as follows: (1) Low noise-level in the plants and construction sites; (2) Eliminated problems associated with vibration; (3) Less labor involved; (4) Faster construction; (5) Improved quality and durability, and; (6) Higher strength. With these benefits, the use of SCC can result in better construction 

quality, productivity, and safety; thus, construction contractors, 

producers and owners who are faced with tougher environmental and 

stricter safety guidelines, and increased construction costs have 

attempted to use SCC in many construction applications. 

Further, SCC has high potential for precast, prestressed concrete 

industry and for cast-in-place construction in the United States. For 

example, a National Cooperative Highway Research Program 

(NCHRP) research project has been initiated to establish SCC bridge 

girder design and construction guidelines to be added to the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Design Factor (AASHTO LRFD) Specifications. The South Carolina State Department of 

Transportation (SCDOT) was to study the use of SCC in drilled shafts 
 and in replacement of four structurally deficient bridges. These 

studies have helped SCDOT use SCC in the drilled shafts and bridges. 

Prestressed SCC girders used for the bridges� replacement can be 

shown in Figure 2. Also, the Kansas State Department of 

Transportation (KSDOT) performed a study of the fresh and hardened 

properties of SCC for use in Kansas prestressed concrete bridge 

girders. KSDOT built a three-span bridge using SCC in only one span 

while the remaining two spans were built using CC. The bridge is 

instrumented and monitored for five years to evaluate its long-term 

performance. In addition to the field studies, experimental studies for 

SCC concrete bridge girders have been performed by South Dakota 

State University (SDSU) in cooperation with the South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT). The flexural behavior of prestressed SCC bridge girders 

subjected to monotonic and fatigue loading was experimentally 

examined at the Lohr Structures Laboratory at SDSU. In this testing, 

three full-scale prestressed bridge girders were made and tested until 

failure. One girder was constructed using CC as a reference specimen, 

while the other two girders were constructed using SCC. It was 

concluded that SCC and CC bridge girders showed similar behavior 

under monotonic and fatigue loading. Figure 3 shows a sample picture 

for the representative SCC bridge girder used for the testing at SDSU. From the brief literature review, it can be concluded that relevant 

studies to understand the structural behaviors of prestressed SCC 

bridge girders and attempt to use SCC in actual prestressed bridge 

girders based upon individual state bridge design guidelines and 

construction methods have been completed. However, there has been 

no specific test data to investigate the material properties (i.e., 

modulus, shrinkage, and creep) of prestressed SCC bridge girders 

related to time-dependent characteristics, flexural stiffness change, 

and prestress losses. Considering these effects is critical for the use of 

SCC in prestressed bridge girders because the structural performance 

of prestressed girders is typically related to the material properties 

associated with time-dependent factors. In particular, the material 

properties of SCC used by precast prestressed girder suppliers to the 

Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) have not been 

examined yet. Lacking substantiated data on the material properties, 

WisDOT has not allowed the use of SCC in prestressed bridge girders 

in Wisconsin. Even precasters have not been able to consistently mix, 

deliver and place SCC in prestressed bridge girder construction. 

Although WisDOT attempted to use SCC in some prestressed girders, 

the producer had difficulty in maintaining uniformity of the mix, and 

problems were observed with excessive segregation of wet batches 

during placement. Hence, widely accepted, uniform recommendations 

for SCC mix design that achieves desired performance for use in

    <abstract>Many bridges on the South Dakota local highway system need

replacement due to deterioration or increased traffic demands. Local 

governments rely on the South Dakota Department of Transportation 

(SDDOT) to help replace them but, with limited resources, SDDOT 

can only help replace about 30 bridges statewide each year, causing a 

backlog of local bridges in need of replacement.

The current standard bridge used in these replacements is the double 

tee precast girder bridge for its relatively low construction cost, 

outsourced design, and short construction duration. The expected 

design life of these bridges was 50 to 70 years, but some built less 

than 40 years ago already need replacement. The most common 

problem is that longitudinal joints become damaged over time, most 

likely due to inadequate shear transfer between the girders, allowing 

water and debris to enter the joints. It is only a matter of time before 

the joint begins to spall, creating a path for moisture to reach the 

prestressing steel, initiate corrosion, and degrade the structural 

capacity of the bridge. It should also be noted that the double tee 

should be designed for girder continuity, often achieved by a 

reinforced concrete overlay or transverse post tensioning. Many local 

bridges are not designed for girder continuity, however, resulting in 

longitudinal joint deterioration and a non-redundant structure.

Routine maintenance of these bridges does increase the life span, but 

is not a feasible long-term solution. The amount of routine 

maintenance required to keep the joints sealed is too costly for local 

governments. Other methods, such as asphalt overlays, are also 

expensive and can cause increased damage over time by trapping 

moisture that eventually reaches the prestressing steel. Thus an 

alternative solution for this problem should be proposed at the design 

stage to reduce joint movements and increase girder continuity. The 

solution can be developed as a new connection detail between girders 

or a more robust precast girder prototype for precast bridges in South 

Dakota.

Bridges on the local system in the State of South Dakota carry 

millions of dollars of agricultural products to market, as well as 

tourists, outdoor adventurist, school buses, and everyday travelers. If 

budgets of local governments cannot increase and the cost of a bridge 

replacement does not decrease, the only option will be to close 

bridges, raising the cost of getting products to market will rise and 

increasing inconvenience to the traveling public. If fewer routes are 

available due to closed bridges, emergency vehicles will experience 

increased response times to rural incidents. The number of 

structurally deficient bridges on the local system only continues to 

grow due to the cost of replacement and limited local government 

budgets. These bridges are vital for agriculture and the traveling 

public and cannot be allowed to close without adverse effects on local 

communities. An immediate solution is desirable.

Due to the poor serviceability performance of longitudinal joints in 

precast double tee bridge girders on South Dakota roads, an 

experimental research project, SD2013-01, was conducted at South Dakota State University (SDSU) 

to investigate the performance of the currently used longitudinal joint 

detail and to assess the adequacy of a proposed new joint detail for 

use with double tee girders (Konrad, M. 2014).  The study involved 

fatigue and strength testing of two full-scale specimens, one 

representing the as-built conditions and the other representing a 

modified joint detailing.  The fatigue load was determined using 

American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications (AASHTO 2012).  The modified joint 

detailing specimen involved overlapping the steel mesh in the joint 

region of adjacent girders.  The grouted joint is 6 inches wide and 

requires some flat formwork during the placement of the grout.  

Results from fatigue and strength testing of the as-built and modified 

specimens revealed that the current joint detailing is severely 

inadequate if the bridge is to last for 50 years or more, while the 

modified joint detail provided adequate performance under fatigue 

loading equivalent to more than 70 years of service.  

Currently, there is only one supplier for the double tee bridge girder 

system in South Dakota.  Alternative precast concrete and other type 

bridge systems may prove to provide potential options for local 

governments when making a bridge type selection based on 

performance and cost.  Therefore, a study is needed to identify 

potential alternative systems and assess the construction feasibility, 

structural performance, and durability of those systems that have 

potential for implementation in South Dakota.</abstract>

    <abstract>In a recent S\outh Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) research project (SD2013-01), which was co-funded 

by SDDOT and the Mountain Plains Consortium (MPC) University 

Transportation Center, South Dakota State University (SDSU) researchers investigated the development 

of a new longitudinal joint detailing for improved performance of 

double-tee girder bridge systems.  The researchers tested at the Lohr 

Structures Lab two full-scale 23&#x2033; deep double-tee girder bridge system 

specimens under fatigue loading.  The fatigue load was determined in 

accordance with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications (AASHTO, 2012).  The 

objective of the tests was to determine the long term performance of 

longitudinal joints built according to the current standard detailing and 

to an alternative proposed detailing.  The fatigue test results revealed 

severe inadequacy of the standard joint and exceptional performance of 

the proposed joint.  The standard joint started to leak at the equivalent of 

4 years in service and the first weld failure in a joint connection 

occurred at the equivalent of 12 years of service.  Most of the welded 

connections failed at the equivalent of 16 years in service.  On the other 

hand, the specimen with the proposed joint detailing was subjected to 

fatigue loading equivalent to more than 100 years of service without 

showing any significant joint or stiffness degradation (Konrad, 2014).

Currently, there are hundreds of double tee bridges on South Dakota 

highways that were built using the standard joint detailing.  Based on 

observed field performance and test results, those bridges may be 

deteriorating at a fast rate and their useful lifespan may be much shorter 

than the expected 50-75 years.  While new bridges can be built using 

the proposed joint detailing developed under project SD2013-01, 

replacing the currently existing deficient bridges would be cost-

prohibitive.  Therefore, a cost-effective retrofit to upgrade the joints of 

existing bridges would be an attractive alternative to replacing deficient 

bridges and extending the life span of existing bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>There is limited experience in the state departments of transportation (DOTs) with rational design for service life. A few notable large signature bridges have been designed for specific service life criteria. But, most agencies rely on subjective evaluation of perceived successful practices for identification and assessment of design alternatives to improve service life. The Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) has developed a Guide for Service Life under the project "Bridges for 100 Year Service." The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures maintains the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications for Bridges as part of its responsibility to design and manage the nation's highway infrastructure. The LRFD Specifications contain requirements for strength design and some serviceability checks. However, there are no comprehensive guidelines for design for service life. A research project has just been completed by SHRP2 titled, R-19A, or "Bridges for 100 Year Service Life." That effort lays the groundwork for establishing recommendations for extending service life and could be useful in developing a process for assuring uniform service life of various bridge components and elements. However, there are some elements of a comprehensive process for service life design that were not included in the SHRP2 project, such as a computerized tool for comparing life-cycle costs of life-extending materials and detailing practices, life-extension technologies for post-tensioned concrete structures, and nationally recognized life-cycle cost parameters for the three major environmental categories: severely corrosive (coastal), moderately corrosive (deicing applications), or mild (dry areas). The research objective is to develop draft guidelines in AASHTO format for Uniform Service Life Design for bridges. There is an urgent need to develop and improve the current methods of bridge service life design. These improved methodologies will increase the reliability and effectiveness of highway bridges, leading to improved durability, safety, and more effective management of bridges in state and local inventories. The results of this research will provide guidelines suitable for implementation by state DOTs.</abstract>

    <abstract>Despite many advances in bridge design, concrete technology, and corrosion-resistant reinforcement, cracking of concrete continues to be a concern for bridge owners; particularly for bridges exposed to severe environments. The presence of cracks provides a direct path for water and chlorides to penetrate the concrete and reach the reinforcement. This in turn, can lead to freeze-thaw damage to the concrete or corrosion of the reinforcement. However, there appears to be little or no correlation between crack width, corrosion, and service life. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  Load and Resistance Factor Design (AASHTO LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications provides requirements for minimum amounts of reinforcement and maximum spacing of reinforcement to control crack widths. In some cases, these requirements are based on in-depth research, while others are based on experience. Nevertheless, bridge owners find the need to supplement the AASHTO provisions with their own requirements. The control of cracking for aesthetic, durability, and structural reasons becomes increasingly important as service life goals are extended and higher strength concrete, higher strength reinforcement, and different types of reinforcement are used in bridge construction. The overall goal of the synthesis is to provide a compilation of methods used to control cracking in concrete bridges and the influence of cracking on long-term durability. Specifically, the synthesis will address the following types of cracking: (1) Flexural cracks in nonprestressed members; (2) Shrinkage cracks in nonprestressed concrete bridge decks; (3) Splitting cracks in pretensioned anchorage zones; (4) Vertical cracks in pretensioned beams prior to transfer of the prestressing force; and (5) Reflective cracking in cast-in-place partial-depth decks and overlays. The synthesis will include information related to the use of steel reinforcement with specified yield strengths from 60 to 100 ksi, corrosion-resistant steel reinforcement, and fiber-reinforced polymer reinforcement. The selection of concrete constituent materials and construction methods to reduce the potential for shrinkage cracking will be addressed. Finally, the synthesis will address remedial measures that may be taken after cracks occur. The synthesis will be beneficial to bridge owners and designers and the AASHTO Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures in their Grand Challenges to extend bridge service life and advance the AASHTO specifications.</abstract>

    <abstract>As demands for infrastructure continue to change and with bridge components deteriorating over time, bridge widening, rehabilitation, and replacement efforts will continue to increase. Depending on site conditions, bridge foundations typically comprise approximately 30 percent or more of the total highway bridge costs. Decisions on whether to reuse, retrofit, or replace existing foundations have a significant impact on the project budget. Reuse of bridge foundations may result in time savings, improved highway safety, and reduced traffic congestion. However, to consider a foundation for reuse, the integrity and capacity (structural and geotechnical) of the existing foundation elements must be reliably determined. The primary concerns with reusing existing bridge foundations are the ability to accurately assess their condition, load carrying capacity, and remaining service life, and the impacts on design codes. Procedures used to evaluate whether foundation reuse is viable for a particular bridge project differ among transportation agencies. A synthesis on current practices for foundation reuse in highway applications is timely as transportation agencies are facing this question more and more on bridge projects. The objective of this synthesis is to document current practices and guidelines used by state transportation agencies for the reuse of bridge foundations. The synthesis will identify strategies and methods that agencies have used to solve problems, as well as identify problems that remain largely unsolved. Information for this study will be gathered through literature review, a survey of state departments of transportation (DOTs), and follow-up interviews with agencies for case examples of their practices. Lessons learned, gaps in information, and suggestions for future research will be included.</abstract>

    <abstract>Software used for bridges and structures is numerous and varied. Some perform specific tasks and functions in analyzing a bridge (such as splice analysis); while others perform a broader analysis over the entire structure. State agencies and consultants struggle to determine which software best addresses their analysis philosophies and project delivery needs. They are burdened with the task of manually entering in the description of the structure, or model for different software used in the analysis. Furthermore, state agencies perform quality control checks and test software packages by employing different software that essentially perform the same task in order to compare the results and establish software acceptance criteria. In addition, most state agencies are not able to keep current software and hardware up to date. These issues could be addressed by using a standardized format that allow bridge and structure modeling be used within multiple software programs and different hardware operating systems during the life of the asset.  Furthermore, this standardized format would be included in other cross function and agency wide models (i.e. Civil Integrated Management (CIM) solutions). The objectives of this project are: (1) synthesize the current state of software used for bridge and structure modelling including formats and requirements; and (2) propose recommendations for future research to develop a common modelling format (i.e., one model for a bridge or a structure) that can be used as a standard input for different software during the life of the asset.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) requires that each state develop a "risk-based asset management plan" and declares that "it is in the vital interest of the United States � to use a data-driven, risk-based approach and cost-effective strategy for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation of highway bridges and tunnels to ensure safety and extended service life." The legislation does not specify a method or performance measures for considering risk. However, the language makes clear the desirability of incorporating risk in a way that can reasonably be supported in a data-driven cost-effective process. Risks of interest include exogenous uncommon hazard that acts on a bridge or a small subset of bridges at random timing and location, and causes a loss of access, seriously degraded functionality for road users, unexpectedly rapid deterioration, or unexpectedly high cost. For these types of risks, it may be possible to estimate hazard likelihood at the level of geographic zones or structure categories, and vulnerability or resilience at the level of individual assets. This probabilistic approximation may enable an agency with suitable tools to quantify and manage risks in a data-driven cost-effective manner even if the exact risk for each bridge can never be measured or the timing of event is not exactly known. The hazards satisfying these criteria may include, but are not limited to, earthquakes and other types of earth movement, hurricanes and tornadoes, floods and scour, fires, vehicular or vessel collisions, fatigue, and advanced deterioration. These hazards have consequences that are beyond the normal deterioration and functional deficiencies already assessed in bridge management systems. The probability of each hazard and the ability of each structure to resist the hazard are not always consistently and quantitatively assessed at the current state of the practice. The objective of this research is to develop proposed American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines for a data-driven risk assessment at the bridge and structure level. At the minimum, the guidelines should consider risks from natural and man-made hazards and should be suitable for use in a bridge management system.</abstract>

    <abstract>With the deterioration of United States (US) infrastructure systems, bridge maintenance, 

performance and the necessity of deck joints and bearings has gained the attention 

of states, municipalities, engineers, researchers, and practitioners alike. Deck joints 

are designed to accommodate translational and rotational movements between two 

adjacent bridge spans while bearings are used in bridges to transfer vertical, 

translational and rotational loads from the superstructure to the abutments or piers. 

It is commonly recognized that deck joints and bearings are costly and complicated 

to install (Tsiatas and Boardman 2002; Wasserman 1987). In addition to greater 

complexity of construction, deck joints and bearings require maintenance 

throughout their life cycles to remain functional and to prevent damage to the 

superstructure (Hawk 2003). Water seepage through deck joints can cause 

significant corrosion to the superstructure and substructures below (Lam et al. 

2008; Loveall 1985). The American Association of State Highway and 

Transportation Officials (AASHTO) also recognizes this problem in the 

commentary section of Chapter 2.5 of the current AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design 

Specifications, which states: 

�Other than the deterioration of the concrete deck itself, the single most prevalent 

bridge maintenance problem is the disintegration of beam ends, bearings, pedestals, 

piers, and abutments due to percolation of waterborne road salts through the deck 

joints. Experience appears to indicate that a structurally continuous deck provides 

the best protection for components below the deck.� 

The current abundance of deck joints originated from the straightforwardness of 

simply supported bridge span design. During the time that simple span bridge 

construction was prevalent, the infrastructure system in the US rapidly grew into its 

current state and a large quantity of bridges and roadways were constructed. 

Without information available regarding the necessary maintenance and repair costs 

of deck joints, a multitude of bridges were constructed as multiple simple spans and 

separated at each pier with deck joints (Tsiatas and Boardman 2002). Recently, the 

use of structural analysis software programs by practicing engineers has become 

commonplace and, therefore, continuous span bridges can now be designed with 

less effort than in the past. However, a substantial amount of older bridges with 

numerous deck joints still exist and pose maintenance and performance challenges 

to state transportation agencies. Bridge retrofits to eliminate deck joints and 

bearings have been proposed and implemented in many cases to alleviate the 

substandard performance of the deck joints (Burke Jr. 1990; Tsiatas and Boardman 

2002; Wasserman 1987). However, the removal of deck joints in order to improve 

bridge performance and increase longevity raises questions about the thermal 

movement bridges must be able to accommodate.  

In the current AASHTO LFRD Bridge Design Specifications discussion of thermal 

effects and discussion of joints and bearings are found in Sections 3 and 14, 

respectively. Multiple requirements for the performance of deck joints and bearings 

are listed, but the number of each should be minimized for a given bridge. The 

definition of setting temperature is provided and processes for estimating thermal 

movements of bridges are explained (AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design 

Specifications 2014). Current AASHTO provisions only require consideration of 

the total longitudinal thermal movement based on the average bridge temperature. 

A vertical thermal gradient is defined in Section 3, but consideration of this 

gradient is not required if past experience indicates that it is not necessary to 

maintain the functionality of the bridge. No mention of gradient in temperature is 

mentioned along the transverse or longitudinal axes. This over-simplified approach 

may result in a minimized design and analysis time since a uniform cross-sectional 

temperature can be assumed, but could potentially lead to inaccurate estimation of 

the demand resulting from the thermal loads and subsequent poor bridge

    <abstract>Inspection of welds in steel bridges is necessary to ensure the quality of workmanship during the fabrication and construction process and later on when the bridge is in service. There are two non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods for evaluation of complete joint penetration (CJP) welds in steel bridges: radiographic (RT) and ultrasonic (UT). Recent advances in enhanced ultrasonic methods, including the development of phased-array ultrasonic technology (PAUT), allow for efficient detection and characterization of flaws with the option of automated data collection and imaging. Criteria for categorizing weld discontinuities as acceptable or unacceptable are codified in the AASHTO/AWS D1.5M/D1.5: Bridge Welding Code (BWC). However, these acceptance criteria do not reflect full use of the capability of enhanced ultrasonic testing methods, and furthermore are not based on the effect of weld discontinuities on bridge performance (e.g., resistance to fatigue and fracture). In addition, some weld discontinuities that are not allowed according to BWC are potentially not harmful and may not decrease service life. An updated acceptance criteria based on enhanced ultrasonic testing methods for evaluation of CJP welds in steel bridges is needed for fabricators and bridge owners. The objectives of this research are to: (1) develop guidelines to evaluate complete joint penetration welds in steel bridges based on updated acceptance criteria and (2) develop proposed modifications to BWC. As a minimum, the guidelines should cover shop and field fabrication and in-service evaluation and include procedures for using enhance ultrasonic testing methods to evaluate CJP welds in steel bridges and pertinent acceptance criteria.</abstract>

    <abstract>The inclusion of uniform temperature effects for bridges has traditionally

been incorporated in design by allowing for expansion and contraction through the 

utilization of bearings and joints or deformations of the piers and abutments in the 

case of integral abutment construction. However, as a result of the growth in the 

multi-modal transportation system, more complex and longer-span bridges are now 

being constructed, requiring new material technologies and design methodologies.  

These modern bridges are increasing the necessity for accurate accounting of 

thermal effects to achieve the desired in-service performance.  In general, 

temperature effects not only include these uniform changes but also changes in 

temperature gradients throughout the day.  A vertical nonlinear temperature 

gradient over the height of the bridge cross section is caused by the relatively low 

thermal conductivity of the concrete deck and the variation of ambient temperature 

magnitudes with time. This nonlinear temperature gradient induces longitudinal 

stresses over the height of each of the girders across the width of the bridge that 

can lead to cracking and unacceptable service conditions if not taken into account 

properly.

The magnitude of the temperature gradients that are produced over the 

height of a bridge structure depend mainly on geometry, location, orientation, 

bridge properties, environment and placement of any asphalt overlay. Imprecise 

thermal analysis of bridges has led to severe cracking and deterioration or even 

failure of structures (Priestley 1978; Moorty and Roeder 1990). To address these 

observed serviceability issues, engineers have at times, reduced the number of 

joints and designed monolithic, cast-in-place structures such as integral-abutment 

bridges. While eliminating the joints solves some serviceability problems, the 

thermal movement of these bridge types are restrained therefore proper detailing 

for the induced stresses are essential.Several theoretical relationships based on one and two dimensional heat

flow theory, solar radiation levels and daily air temperature distribution have been 

proposed to predict the changes in the nonlinear temperature distribution over a 

typical bridge cross section. Although the exact procedures for these proposed 

relationships vary, the consistent objective is to obtain a better estimate of the 

temperature profile and resulting stress distribution (Roeder 2003). Thepchatri and 

Johnson (1978) proposed a method to quantify temperature effects for various 

types of highway bridge cross sections including different environmental 

conditions by using finite-element analyses that incorporated heat flow and thermal 

relationships.  The researchers validated their proposed methodology with 

measured data. Priestley et al. (1984) developed a thermal design procedure based 

on research conducted in New Zealand. The overall design philosophy consisted of 

three steps.  First, the engineer obtained the predicted critical design gradient based 

on known local ambient characteristics. Second, a calculation of the corresponding 

stress levels based on simple statics induced in the bridge superstructure by the 

design thermal gradient was performed. Third, the influence of the thermally 

induced stresses for serviceability and ultimate load states was quantified. This 

procedure served as a basis for the development of the thermal design gradient that 

was eventually adopted in several design procedures. 

Roeder (2003) proposed an alternative procedure to Priestley�s Method for 

determining bridge design temperatures and thermal movements. For this research, 

1,273 temperature measurements with an average time history of 70.7 years taken 

from different locations throughout the United States were utilized. This diverse 

data set resulted in the creation of bridge temperature design maps for initially steel 

girder bridges and subsequentally concrete girder bridges throughout the 

continental 48 states. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Load and Factor Design (AASHTO LRFD) Specifications adopted this method in 

2005.  Other studies that have quantified the temperature effects on bridges include 

Emerson (1982), Branco and Mende (1993), Newhouse et al. (2008), Lee (2012) 

and Cai et al. (2012).

The research that has been performed is all based on limited sensor 

readings in the deck where the temperature gradient is the most severe.  This 

research will result in a high-density array of data that not only quantifies changes 

in temperature vertically by also transversely across the bridge width.</abstract>

    <abstract>This project proposes to analyze and measure the robustness of transportation infrastructure facilities and systems. This proposal falls into the University Transportation Research Center (UTRC) category of �faculty-initiated research projects�. It addresses a topic related to the goals of �maintaining an infrastructure transportation system in a state of good repair� to �enhance the Nation�s economic competitiveness�, which have been designated by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and UTRC as key research areas.

To meet the criterion of �state of good repair�, transportation infrastructure systems must provide an adequate peak�hour, Level of Service (LOS). LOS is measured in units of traffic (vehicles or passengers), that traverse a unit distance (1 mile), per unit time (1 hour) at a minimum required speed (mile/hour) and at minimum safety level (collision rates). LOS deterioration is due to normal usage and natural depreciation in infrastructure quality, or due to impacts of rare disastrous shocks such as a major storm. From economic perspective, a decline in LOS carries significant economic costs to users in terms of increased travel times, reduced system reliability, and increased vehicle operating costs.</abstract>

    <abstract>Reinforced concrete is used worldwide for roads, bridges, buildings, and hazardous material storage - structures meant to last 50 years or more. As the concrete ages, chloride attack, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), and freeze-thaw cycles cause cracking, which weakens the structure and makes the concrete and reinforcing steel vulnerable to further damage. In Delaware, ASR damage is widespread in roadways. ASR occurs when the aggregates have high concentrations of reactive silica, which is a common feature of aggregates sourced in the Mid-Atlantic states. If, during the design phase, the aggregates are known to cause ASR, the concrete mixture can be adjusted to prevent future problems. However, in existing structures, ASR effects are only identified when visible cracks develop, after extensive chemical changes and internal damage have already occurred. ASR is a chemical reaction between the alkaline cementitious materials and reactive silica present in certain aggregates. When there are available cations in the concrete pore solution, reactive silica in the aggregate, and sufficient moisture, a gel-like material forms in the concrete, absorbs water and expands, exerting tensile forces within the concrete matrix and causing cracking. External water easily penetrates the cracked concrete, exacerbating ASR and increasing the potential for other kinds of damage, further deteriorating the concrete. Because the chemistry of ASR-affected concrete differs from that of undamaged concrete, the principal investigators hypothesize that its microbial population will also be different. In water quality, food safety and soil sciences, microbes are used as bio-indicators for system health. The investigators propose to identify microbial species found only in alkali-silica reaction (ASR)-damaged concrete, for use as a bio-indicator for this type of damage. Developing a bio-indicator for ASR-related damage would enable production of a rapid, simple test that could be used to identify ASR-induced damage before visible cracking has occurred. This work will contribute to the Mid-Atlantic Transportation Sustainability Center- University Transportation Center (MATS-UTC) focus area of coastal infrastructure resiliency by enabling earlier diagnosis of a problem that is especially common in this area. During the past 2 years, Maresca's laboratory at the University of Delaware (UD) has developed a method for extraction of DNA from concrete and cultivated more than 15 bacterial species from the same samples. The investigators have shown that the bacterial communities in and on concrete, as identified by DNA analysis, include more than 200 species and are unique to the concrete environment. Many of the species in these samples have tough membranes and are related to bacteria found in deserts and soda lakes - other dry, alkaline environments. The cultivated bacteria are a limited but representative subset of those identified by DNA analysis.  The MATS UTC research team, led by UD, proposes to identify microbial biomarkers of ASR dam-age by applying these new techniques to both laboratory-made concrete samples and core samples obtained from ASR-damaged roadways in Delaware and Virginia. In 2013, we prepared ASR-prone con-crete cylinders using materials from the Delaware Department of Transportation (DeIDOT). We prepared a parallel set of test cylinders that included fly ash, DeIDOT's standard protocol for prevention of ASR. These cylinders were placed on the green roof, and one of each set has been harvested every 6 weeks since then. By analyzing microbial communities in ASR-prone and mitigated test cylinders left outside to weather over the course of 2 years, the investigators will identify microbial species present in undamaged samples and those that thrive best as the chemistry of ASR-prone concrete changes. The investigators will also use these samples to develop methods that require less sample material, and to develop and test assays for specific bacteria.  To confirm that any bio-indicators - either of damage or of "normal" concrete - identified in our laboratory samples are relevant in field assessments, the investigators will compare these results with the microbes identified in ASR-damaged road samples. Maresca and Harris have contacts with DeIDOT and the Virginia Department of Transportation, respectively, and will obtain core samples from ASR-affected roadways, as well as samples from nearby, undamaged roadways. This &amp;amp;#64257;eld component will be crucial both to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed tests and to determine whether our results are specific to materials used in Delaware or can be applied throughout the mid-Atlantic.  Although microbes have long been known to degrade concrete and have more recently been employed to repair it. the study of concrete as a unique environment hosting a variety of microbes capable of different effects on their milieu has been neglected. The methods developed as part of this research will contribute both to improved diagnosis of ASR-type damage to concrete, and to a better fundamental understanding of the natural populations acting in and on concrete as it weathers.  Researchers from UD and the University of Virginia (UVA) will conduct research from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Maresca, a microbiologist in UD's Civil and Environmental Engineering department. will lead the analysis of microbial communities in concrete. Harris, an expert in civil infrastructure, has a mobile laboratory for rapid evaluation of transportation infrastructure (MOBLab), which is well suited for field studies. The investigator also has a number of ongoing collaborations with the Virginia Center for Transportation Innovation and Research, the research arm of the Virginia Department of Transportation. His contribution will primarily focus on obtaining &amp;amp;#64257;eld samples of ASR-damaged concrete from different localities and undamaged samples from the same general areas. As the investigators develop easier tests for ASR-associated microbes, we propose to supply the MOBLab with the equipment and reagents necessary to deploy these tests in the &amp;amp;#64257;eld.  To extend roadway lifetimes, potential problems must be identi&amp;amp;#64257;ed early enough that repair, rather than replacement, is feasible. Early bio-indicators of damage would allow DOTS to implement chemical remediation for ASR before visible cracking and structural damage have occurred. A bio-indicator is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive tool that would provide data to support early identi&amp;amp;#64257;cation and remediation of roadways susceptible to speci&amp;amp;#64257;c types of damage. Because this approach could extend roadway lifetimes, state and local DOTS could stretch limited funds. Earlier diagnosis of a problem that is especially common in the Mid-Atlantic Coast region will contribute to the MATS-UTC focus area of coastal infrastructure structure resiliency. In addition, characterization of microbes native to concrete environments will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of life in dry, salty, alkaline conditions, and to the development of future tools in bio-repair of concrete.  Results from project research will be published in peer reviewed journals and will be presented at large national conferences. Researchers will work collaboratively with the Delaware Department of Transportation to implement project outcomes into new DOT speci&amp;amp;#64257;cations. as appropriate. Wherever possible, new &amp;amp;#64257;eld projects will be conducted as "Demonstration Projects"., which will be open to a variety of researchers and other employees from various DOTS throughout the MATS consortium area.</abstract>

    <abstract>The introduction of element inspection condition methods in the early 1990s represented a significant advancement in bridge inspection practice and has been adopted by the vast majority of the state transportation departments in the United States. Bridge owners nationwide have recognized the benefits of detailed condition assessments through the use of the raw inspection information, expanded performance measures, and bridge management system deterioration forecasting and evaluation (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials [AASHTO] Manual for Bridge Element Inspection, First Edition, 2013). With the adoption of the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection by the AASHTO Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures in 2013, to meet the requirements in the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)" legislation and to ensure the safety of the motoring public, the bridge owners need guidelines to promote (1) consistency in the collection of element-level data for bridges on the National Highway System (NHS) and (2) collection of reliable data that support asset management practices. The objective of this research is to develop guidelines to improve the quality of element-level data collection for the NHS Bridges in reference to the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection. At the minimum, the guidelines should include recommendations to: (1) improve consistency in data collection and assessment of bridge element conditions and (2) establish accuracy levels for element conditions and applicable defect quantities to support bridge management system deterioration forecasting and evaluation.</abstract>

    <abstract>This research project should help the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) prepare a specification that will increase the probability of achieving crack free, long-lasting decks. The research will develop a state-of-the-art bridge concrete that will give a unique consideration to coming up with the best mix characteristics that will ultimately extend bridge life and delay (or eliminate) the need to replace decks prior to superstructure replacement. The two main objectives of this study are: (1) The bridge deck will be crack-free immediately after construction. (2) The bridge deck has the strength and serviceability characteristics that will allow it to perform for up to 75 years of active service.</abstract>

    <abstract>Texas Department of Transportation's (TxDOT's) Fort Worth District installed a novel lightweight fill material, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) geofoam, as part of a rehabilitation of the US 67 bridge over SH 174 in Johnson County. The bridge embankment constructed in 1995. is approximately 40 ft. high. Readily available moderate plasticity clay soil has been adopted as the fill material. For the past 16 years, the approach slabs at each end of this bridge had experienced more than 17 in. of settlement. The District funded a rehabilitation project to remove the modular block walls underneath, construct 3:1 slopes, repair bridge beams, and remove and replace 150 ft. of approach slab and pavement on each end. EPS geofoam was selected due to its lightweight and high compressibility attribute. The weight of EPS geofoam utilized is only a small fraction of soil that was excavated. Geofoam was designed to replace 6 feet of the embankment from the bottom of the bridge abutment upward. The additional 2 ft. remaining at the top of pavement was constructed with a 10 in. layer of item 247 flexible base, 4 in. of item 3224 Type. B hot mix, and 10 in. of CRCP concrete pavement. This rehabilitation work started in January 2012 and was completed in the following month (February 2012). This area was instrumented with four (4) horizontal inclinometers and four (4) pressure cells to monitor the settlement behavior and pressure response of the embankment in relation to the dead load of the overlying pavement structure, live traffic loading, embankment settlement, and pressure against the abutment and wingwalls. After the completion of installation in February 2012, University of Texas, Arlington (UTA) research team conducted field performance monitoring at regular interval. It can be observed from the horizontal inclinometer data that during the three years after opening to traffic, less than 1.5 in. (38 mm) of post-construction vertical displacement [settlement] has occurred. No visible deformation or bump is observed in the concrete pavement surface. However, soil erosion at shoulder and a 3 in. (76mm) differential settlement at the pavement has been observed and documented on the south side slope of the embankment. it appears that the slope soil is creeping laterally away from the roadway thereby leading to this differential settlement at the pavement and wing wall edge. Continual wet soil exists at the end of a drain line installed at the end of the wing wall during construction and draining down the slope. The origin of this water is still unknown. Due to the continual soil movement and water draining from under the approach slab, the influencing factors contributing to settlement of geofoam installation are not yet identified. Additional data collection is desired in order to evaluate the longer-term performance of the EPS geofoam in this embankment. Hence, continued site visits for data collection need to be conducted for at least 5 to 6 years. Long-term performance data will also help in the formulation of design charts for future use of EPS geofoam in other projects.</abstract>

    <abstract>As truck weights and volumes increase and the bridge infrastructure ages, owners have a vital need to access quality truck and load performance data for bridge management and operations decision-making purposes. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of truck traffic on bridge performance.  This multi-year study will collect quality truck traffic and loads data (volumes, classifications, size, weights, and other relevant data) by installing, maintaining, calibrating, and utilizing instrumentation at selected bridge sites nationally, for the purpose of calibrating bridge specifications and quantifying load-induced deterioration of bridge elements and systems to establish bridge performance and serviceability criteria for improved long-term bridge performance, management and operations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The performance and safety of the transportation infrastructure are greatly affected by aging mechanisms caused by surrounding physical and chemical stressors. Considering the significant costs and consequences originating from the degradation of existing infrastructure components, there is an immediate need to identify the inspection and maintenance strategies that take into account the current state of degradation and provide reliable estimates of vulnerability during the expected service life. This can be achieved through the identification of appropriate measures that update the lifecycle predictions based on the data collected from health monitoring systems.

To ensure that the most current state of deteriorating components are considered for both vulnerability assessment and resource allocation purposes, multi-state condition-based strategies are investigated in this project. While similar strategies have been commonly used for manufacturing systems, proper integration of them into the management of transportation networks is expected to be a major step forward. The outcome of this project will directly contribute to providing non-periodic, adaptive plans for inspection and maintenance activities. Furthermore, the issues associated with �imperfect inspection data� and �partial repair actions� will be properly addressed through the developed framework.</abstract>

    <abstract>Many transportation departments have significant practical experience with bridge preservation and have developed conclusions regarding the effectiveness of bridge preservation actions based on those experiences. However, limited efforts have been made to identify, measure, evaluate, and document the short- and long-term performance of specific bridge preservation actions. Bridge preservation consists of actions to deter or correct deterioration of a bridge to extend its useful (service) life and does not entail structural or operational improvements beyond the originally designed strength or capacity of the bridge. Often practitioners apply preservation strategies on the basis of judgment or common sense using available resources. However, it is difficult to translate these strategies into coherent and convincing arguments in the absence of a quantitative measurement of bridge preservation effectiveness. The objective of this research is to develop a bridge preservation guide for possible adoption by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The proposed AASHTO guide shall be developed based on data to be collected from representative agencies. At the minimum, the guide shall include: (1) a catalog of bridge element preservation actions and (2) the criteria and selection methodology of bridge preservation actions with associated costs and benefits for use in life cycle cost analysis and possible integration into a bridge management system. Accomplishment of the project objective will require at least the following tasks: Proposers are asked to develop a detailed research plan for accomplishing the project objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objective. The work proposed for each phase must be divided into tasks and proposers must describe the work proposed in each task in detail. PHASE I - Planning: Task 1. Conduct a critical review of existing technical literature, pertinent international and domestic scans, the reports prepared under National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 14-23 (see Special Note A), and other NCHRP projects. In addition, the review should include owner and industry practices, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Long Term Bridge Performance (LTBP) Program, and other research findings from both foreign and domestic sources. Task 2. Identify the required data to be collected in order to achieve the research objective and propose 8 agencies for data collection considering diverse service environments. The project panel will select at least 4 agencies for data collections under Phase II. Task 3. Prepare a list of bridge preservation actions to be developed under Phase II. Task 4. Prepare a detailed outline of proposed AASHTO guide. Task 5. Develop the data archiving and sharing plan as described in Special Note C. Task 6.Prepare Interim Report No. 1 that documents Tasks 1 through 5 of Phase I and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project no later than 3 months after contract award. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases II through IV Note: Following a 1-month review by the NCHRP, the research team will be required to meet with the�project panel to discuss Interim Report No. 1, if necessary. Work on Phases II through IV of the project will not begin until authorized by the NCHRP. Phase I shall be limited to $15,000. PHASE II - Catalog of Bridge Preservation Actions: Task 7. Collect and perform data mining to achieve the research objective. Information from agencies should be augmented by documented research. Task 8. Develop the catalog of bridge preservation actions focusing on the bridge elements that significantly impact the bridge service life (e.g., bridge deck, joints, coated steel, etc.). At a minimum, the catalog shall include: action type; material; description; cost; and how long the action lasts and when it should be applied based on condition. Task 9. Propose a method, for further analysis in Phase III, to establish &lt;span&gt;the criteria and selection methodology of bridge preservation actions using life cycle cost analysis with supporting examples. Task 10. Prepare an annotated description of each section and subsection of the proposed guide along with the expected level of detail of each subsection. Task 11. Prepare Interim Report No. 2 that documents Tasks 7 through 10 of Phase II and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project no later than 6 months after Phase I approval. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases III through IV. Note: The contractor shall meet with the project panel 1 month after submission of Phase II deliverables. Work on Phase III of the project will not begin until Interim Report No. 2 is approved and the work plan is authorized by the NCHRP. Phase II shall be limited to $85,000. PHASE III - Draft Guide for Bridge Preservation Actions: Task 12. Establish the analysis of the proposed method according to the approved Task 9. Task 13. Prepare the proposed AASHTO guide based on the outcome of previous tasks Task 14. Prepare Interim Report No. 3 that documents the result of Tasks 12 and 13 no later than 8 months after approval of Phase II. Note: Work on Phase IV of the project will not begin until authorized by the NCHRP. PHASE IV - Final Products: Task 15. Update the proposed AASHTO guide after consideration of review comments. Task 16. Prepare a final report that documents the entire research effort. Note: Phases III through IV shall be limited to $200,000. Following receipt of the draft final report, the remaining 3 months shall be for NCHRP review and comment and for research agency response and preparation of the revised final report.  SPECIAL NOTES: The agency final deliverables (final report, handbook sections, and Appendix E) prepared under NCHRP Project 14-23 contain information on possible &lt;span&gt;bridge preservation actions. Proposers are encouraged to review these materials and, if appropriate, to consider the described bridge preservation actions as a basis for the bridge preservation actions that will be developed in this research.  A. The agency final deliverables are available at:  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NCHRP14-23_FR-ReportSections.pdf  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NCHRP14-23_FR-HandbookSections.pdf http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NCHRP14-23_FR-AppendixETables.pdf B. The research team should anticipate making two presentations to appropriate AASHTO technical committees of the AASHTO Highway Subcommittees.  C. To ensure that data produced under this project are accessible, a data archiving and sharing plan shall be prepared by the agency performing research.�The plan must be submitted in Phase I and shall include a description of expected activities, schedules, limitations, milestones, and required resources. Researchers should describe briefly the expected schedule for data production and archiving in the NCHRP permanent repository, the format of the final dataset, the documentation to be provided, and whether or not any analytic tools and/or results also will be provided. The plan must include a description of actions planned to ensure quality. Moreover, the plan must specify the resources required to archive and distribute the data expected to be obtained in the course of performing the research. In general, public release of data will not occur before full review and approval by the NCHRP project panel.  The data archiving and sharing plan must include the following sections: (1) Background and significance</abstract>

    <abstract>The structural deterioration of aging infrastructure systems and the costs of repairing these systems is an increasingly important issue worldwide. Structural health monitoring (SHM), most commonly visual inspection and condition rating, has proven to be a cost-effective method for detecting and evaluating damage. However, the effectiveness varies depending on the availability and experience of personnel performing the largely qualitative damage evaluations. 

The artificial neural network (ANN) approach presented in this study attempts to augment visual inspection through a crack-induced damage quantification model for reinforced concrete bridge girders that requires only the results of limited field measurements to operate.

Using Abaqus finite element (FE) analysis software, the researchers modeled simply supported three-dimensional concrete T-beams with varying geometric, material, and cracking properties. The ANNs achieved excellent prediction accuracies, with coefficients of determination exceeding 0.99 for both networks. Additionally, the ANNs displayed good predictions accuracies when predicting damage levels in beams not included in the database. Results indicate promise for this application of ANNs.

Utilizing the two top-performing network architectures, the researchers developed a touch-enabled software application for use as an on-site bridge member damage evaluation tool in the field. The application was given the acronym BRIDGES, for Bridge Rating for Induced Damage in Girders: Evaluation Software. The application�s outputs were validated as matching the ANN predictions.

The researchers developed a similar software application for the reverse problem/damage detection and use as an on-site damage prediction tool. This application tries to predict the crack configurations using ANN, based on the geometrical and material parameters, as well as the nine nodal stiffness ratios. This touch-enabled application was given the acronym DRY BEAM, for Damage Recognition Yielding Bridge Evaluation After Monitoring.</abstract>

    <abstract>The recently completed Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Storm Surge and Wave Atlas contains significant hydraulic information that will be useful in analyzing storm surge and wave forces on existing and new coastal bridges. The current Atlas contains surge and wave information for storms with a 1% chance of occurrence each year (100-year return interval). This information is useful for computing wave loads on bridge superstructures. However, many issues encountered by DOTD engineers require other frequency meteorological/oceanographic information (e.g., 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-year return intervals). For instance, engineers may design a temporary facility (a detour bridge) based on a 5-year return interval (20% chance of occurrence each year). Bridges whose service life is approaching their design life may undergo retrofitting based on a return interval different from the 100-year return interval. The information needed for these designs exists in the Level III analysis solution files developed in the recently completed Wave and Surge Atlas (Phase I) project. Because of the size of the study area and the amount of information available in the recently completed Surge/Wave Atlas (GIS database) for the 100-year return interval, it is prudent to provide a separate geographic information system (GIS) database for each of the other desired return intervals. Therefore, this work will produce a separate GIS database for a 50-year return interval (2% chance of occurrence each year), a 25-year return interval (4% chance of occurrence each year), a 10-year return interval (10% chance of occurrence each year), and a 5-year return interval (20% chance of occurrence each year). This research intends to develop and extend the previously completed wave and surge atlas for the design and evaluation of coastal bridges in south Louisiana.</abstract>

    <abstract>Several sustainability rating, scorecard, and quantitative and/or qualitative performance metrics tools exist to assist in the assessment of sustainability of bridge projects, e.g. the Sustainable Transportation Analysis and Rating System (STARS) and INVEST. These tools are mostly applied after a project is completed or late in the decision when most of the retrofit details have been decided. What is needed are tools to help in the early stages of decision-making about whether to repair or reconstruct bridges when there are more choices open and hence a greater ability to radically reduce environmental and societal impacts. What is missing is the life cycle inventory data to allow comparison of construction and maintenance techniques for sustainability objectives, such as worker safety and increased ozone emission from slowed and stopped car traffic, in addition to cost. This research will set up the framework for a life cycle inventory database for bridge repair and construction techniques including social and environmental sustainability concerns. Bridge experts and practitioners will be recruited to upload their information about the service life of bridges and sustainability impacts to this database. This research will also modify existing early-state commercial product design decision-making tools to create an applicable tool for bridge retrofit decisions utilizing sustainability information available in the life cycle inventory database.</abstract>

    <abstract>The choice of load rating method may affect the transportation of goods and services over the nation's highways by imposing load limits on routes that were previously unrestricted. For culvert load rating, engineers use the load and resistance factor rating (LRFR), load factor rating (LFR), or allowable stress rating (ASR) of highway bridges according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual for Bridge Evaluation. However, culverts respond to live loads differently than bridges as a result of surrounding soils. Moreover, the LRFR is calibrated based primarily on bridge response to gross truck weight, while culvert response should be calibrated based on a single axle or a single wheel. As a result, the current specifications may be either overly conservative or inadequate, which may lead to expensive replacements or upgrades, or premature deterioration or failure, respectively.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to develop a load rating process for culvert structures to maintain an acceptable level of culvert reliability without unnecessary restrictions on commerce. The objective of this research is to propose modifications to the culvert load rating specifications in AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation and revise the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design  (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications accordingly. At a minimum, the research should address: (1) different culvert types, sizes, cover thicknesses, the effect of pavement, soil effects, and live loads; and (2) a comparison between LRFR, LFR, and ASR methods.  The LRFR specification shall be calibrated based on proposed reliability indices, load factors, and load distribution.</abstract>

    <abstract>Field welded repairs and retrofits can strengthen older bridges and improve their fatigue life. For example, distortion induced fatigue cracking in older bridges can be mitigated through field welded retrofit details. In other cases, field welded details have been used to strengthen bridges or repair those that have experienced section loss. Some engineers have taken advantage of such solutions, but others lack knowledge, experience, or confidence about effective use of field welding to extend bridge service life. The objective of this synthesis is to document field welded repair and retrofit solutions and practices that owners have used on existing bridges. Results will help bridge owners evaluate and implement solutions for successfully extending the service life of their bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Managing a growing population of deteriorated transportation infrastructure systems (i.e. bridges, railways, tunnels) is one of biggest challenges faced by the nation. Traditional inspection and monitoring techniques (e.g., visual inspection, mechanical sounding, rebound hammer, cover meter, electrical potential measurements, ultrasound, ground penetrating radar) for bridges, railways, and tunnels require lane closure and are labor intensive and time-consuming.  Existing remote sensing techniques (e.g., light detection and radar (LiDAR), aerial photos) using fixed-wing aircraft are capable of conducting large-area inspection but are constrained by viewing areas accessible only from above, at a large distance, and are not capable of inspecting all areas of interest (e.g., bridge piers, bridge girder bottom, and tunnel walls). Automated, low-cost, efficient inspection techniques for interrogating critical components of bridges, railways, and tunnels are needed.  The objective of this project is to develop a system-level, decision-support unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensing system for the autonomous, efficient inspection of bridges, railways, and tunnels, using radar, digital image correlation, and thermal sensors. The proposed UAV sensing system represents the next generation of rapid, low-cost interrogation technology for infrastructure inspection and monitoring of critical transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the objective of this project is to develop a mobile platform that can be used to autonomously interrogate numerous areas on civil structures easily without requiring expensive, time consuming aerial lifts or inconsistent visual inspections.  The proposed sensing platform will include innovative continuous wave imaging radar, digital image correlation, and thermal imaging to monitor structures or quantify damage.  The sensing approach has already been demonstrated to provide accurate large area interrogation of bridges and will be built on a proven quad-rotor aircraft that is currently employed by the U.S. Army and manufactured by PSI Incorporated.  The project will enable the next generation of rapid inspection and evaluation of bridges, railways, and tunnels.

    <abstract>Because bridges represent the most expensive, by square foot, assets on the transportation system, they require sophisticated maintenance and management schemes.  To improve and maintain the structural performance of highway bridges in a more efficient, holistic, and reliable manner, bridge maintenance and management is slowly moving towards the integration of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques which can measure, evaluate, and predict bridge integrity. Unfortunately, no current bridge management systems have the ability to integrate SHM data. As part of advancing their maintenance strategies for highway bridges in Iowa, the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) has focused recent research efforts on the development of SHM systems with new algorithms that estimate bridge health by making on-site, quantitative measurements (e.g., strain, acceleration, etc.). These efforts have led to the creation of a series of Iowa DOT projects which have made great strides in the development of data processing and interpretation algorithms (e.g., for damage detection, load rating estimation, etc.). The objective of this project is to develop/conceptualize a bridge asset management framework capable of integrating SHM data with other processes including traditional inspection processes, information technology, and geographic information systems to improve overall bridge management. This project not only helps in understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in structural health conditions between bridges under the same ambient traffic and environmental conditions (e.g., for improving current deterioration predictions) but also aids decision makers with quantitative statewide bridge management.</abstract>

    <abstract>High Mast Illumination Poles (HMlPs) are used throughout Texas and the United States (US) to provide lighting along highways and at interchanges. Texas currently has about 5000 HMlPs, varying in height from 100 to 175 ft. In recent years, a number of HMlP collapses have been reported in other states. These collapses have been attributed to fatigue failures at the HMIP shaft-to-base plate connection. This project will generate data and information to support a probabilistic-based assessment of the remaining life of pre-cracked HMIPs. Laboratory fatigue tests will be conducted on pie-cracked galvanized HMIPs. In addition, field data will be collected and additional analyses will be conducted to characterize wind response of Texas HMIPs. Field and laboratory studies will be supplemented by finite element studies simulating the global and local response of pie-cracked HMIPs. The results of the laboratory data, field studies, and analytical studies will be combined in a reliability-based framework to provide a probabilistic assessment of the fatigue life of in-service pre-cracked HMIPs. Finally, additional information will be developed in this project on options for mitigating risk associated with cracked HMIPs, such as increased inspection and monitoring, repair techniques, and methods to reduce vortex shedding.</abstract>

    <abstract>The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) M 270 (ASTM A709), Standard Specification for Structural Steel for Bridges, covers the chemical, mechanical, and toughness properties of structural steel intended for use in bridges. The AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code covers the welding processes and requirements for welded highway bridges, but it does not address the toughness requirements for heat-affected zones (HAZs) of welded structural steel. Also, toughness requirements for HAZs of welded structural steel are not covered in AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.There is a need to identify the factors affecting the toughness for HAZs of welded structural steels used in highway bridges and determine what toughness requirements are necessary for incorporation in the AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. This information will ensure that the HAZs will exhibit the toughness properties that are necessary for the intended performance and service life. The objective of this research is to develop proposed toughness requirements for the heat-affected zones (HAZs) of welded structural steels for highway bridges. The research shall deal with steels intended for use in bridges as identified in AASHTO M 270, Standard Specification for Structural Steel for Bridges. </abstract>

    <abstract>The weights and configurations of large vehicles traveling the primary interstate system are known with relative certainty due to the information collected at numerous weigh stations. It is uncommon, however, that farm-to-market vehicles and other implements of husbandry (IoH) travel the interstate system; thus, an accurate assessment of the characteristics of these vehicles is left unknown. Since these vehicles commonly travel rural roads, and often at weights exceeding the legal limit especially during harvest, an accurate understanding of low-volume road usage is necessary to properly plan for the near-term repair and replacement of structures and roadways; even more, the information collected will help improve the long-term performance and asset management activities. 

A recently completed pooled-fund project, which the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) was the lead state on, looked to assess the impact of implements of husbandry on bridges. Those efforts produced valuable information especially as it relates to lateral load distribution. Even so, the project was largely completed using a database of virtual vehicles developed through information provided by equipment manufacturers and rule-of-thumb. Although it is believed the database generally represented current vehicles, the accuracy cannot be verified without direct measurement of all vehicles. Furthermore, one piece of missing information is the frequency with which those vehicles cross low-volume road bridges. 

The objective of this project was to develop a portable weigh-in-motion system using a rural road bridge to estimate the characteristics of vehicles traveling these roads. A unique instrumentation setup was utilized with strain gages placed on the bottom face of the deck as well as on the top and bottom flanges of the girders, which allowed for the application of algorithms for vehicle classification determination. Further classification of the IoH vehicles is made possible by actual determination of specific vehicle type based on strain response and the corresponding number and spacing of axles. This vehicle information provides actual loading and corresponding bridge response and, thus, maintenance decisions and actual structural demands can be properly selected based on existing traffic types and frequencies. The system developed for this project can be deployed on rural bridges for realistic traffic classifications.

    <abstract>American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) M 270 (ASTM A709), Standard Specification for Structural Steel for Bridges, covers the chemical, mechanical, and toughness properties of structural steel intended for use in bridges. The AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code covers the welding processes and requirements for welded highway bridges, but it does not address the toughness requirements for heat-affected zones (HAZs) of welded structural steel. Also, toughness requirements for HAZs of welded structural steel are not covered in AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications. There is a need to identify the factors affecting the toughness for HAZs of welded structural steels used in highway bridges and determine what toughness requirements are necessary for incorporation in the AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. This information will ensure that the HAZs will exhibit the toughness properties that are necessary for the intended performance and service life. The objective of this research is to develop proposed toughness requirements for the heat-affected zones (HAZs) of welded structural steels for highway bridges. The research shall deal with steels intended for use in bridges as identified in AASHTO M 270, Standard Specification for Structural Steel for Bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Center for Advanced Infrastructure &amp;amp; Transportation (CAIT) anticipates completion of an innovative, full scale load testing laboratory for evaluation of new and advanced materials and devices. This instrument will allow, for the first time, the scientific study of deterioration processes on full-scale bridges. While the merits of the equipment are well documented, until recently there has been little discussion pertaining to the development of experimental protocols, instrumentation and specimen design. With the dawn of accelerated structural testing within the horizon, it is imperative for the development of these key elements be initiated and completed. The objectives of this research is threefold: (1) develop experimental protocols for conducting accelerated structural testing in the new laboratory; (2) design an initial instrumentation plan to validate the laboratory's performance metrics, and; (3) establish baseline acceleration time factors.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concrete is the most widely used material in construction, offering advantages in terms of moisture and fire resistance, versatility, cost, energy-efficiency, and environmental impact. Concrete provides a relatively high level of compressive strength; its tensile strength, however, is fairly low, and concrete members crack on the tension side under the application of small loads. Hence, most concrete systems generally incorporate reinforcing steel to resist tensile. While reinforcing steel receives a certain level of protection against corrosion from the surrounding concrete, the corrosion of reinforcing steel is still a predominant factor undermining the longevity of the vast concrete-based infrastructure. The presence of both air and water is required for corrosion activity to start, and, after tensile crack formation, it will accelerate. However, corrosion may be slowed down considerably if the diffusion of oxygen and harmful ions, such as chloride ions, through the concrete could be reduced. The new concept of self-healing concrete was introduced over the past decade, and many researchers are still investigating the feasibility of the process at a laboratory scale. There are two objectives for the self-healing concrete: (1) recovery of strength after the formation of cracks and (2) sealing the cracks to prevent further concrete deterioration, such as that resulting from corrosion. Several approaches for concrete self-healing are proposed in the literature, such as bacteria encapsulation, mineral admixture, chemical in glass tubing, etc. Most of the proposed methods focused on the second objective and showed promising results for eliminating or reducing the cracks that form first, when the concrete is still relatively young, under dry or wet conditions. However, very few studies have been done to show the versatility and repeatability of some the most promising approaches, such as bacterial encapsulation.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge expansion joints are designed to accommodate bridge movement and rotation as well as to protect the bridge superstructure and substructure elements such as beam/girder ends, piers, abutments, pedestals, and bearings from runoff water and deicing chemicals. Proper performance of bridge expansion joints has a significant impact on the service life of multiple bridge elements, and therefore, the long-term serviceability of the bridge. The origins of many extensive bridge rehabilitations and even replacement projects can be traced back to the condition of expansion joints. Therefore, bridge owners invest significant resources toward the design, construction, and maintenance of bridge expansion joints. Nonetheless, the performance of bridge joints has been problematic for bridge owners across the country. Improper sizing of the joint seal, poor substrate preparation, and improper application have been cited as some of the reasons for joint failures. To overcome these failure mechanisms, bridge owners need clear guidelines for evaluating the performance of bridge expansion joints and maintaining them.
�
The objective of this research�was to develop proposed guidelines with commentary for evaluating and maintaining small movement bridge joints (i.e., 4 in. or less) to support the decisions of bridge owners. The proposed guidelines with commentary should cover as a minimum: (1) joint failure mechanisms; (2) performance metrics (e.g., service life and life cycle costs (LCC)) to select the best performing joints considering bridge geometry, environmental loading, and other factors; and (3) procedures for maintenance, repair, and replacement of bridge joints. 


The research team is working with the AASHTO Subcommittee on Maintenance, Bridge Technical Working Group (BTWG) on the appropriate format of publishing the guidelines. The research agency�s final report that documents the entire research effort and the draft guidelines are available online at:

    <abstract>The objective of this study was to determine the economic impact of designing pre-tensioned prestressed concrete beam (PPCB) bridges utilizing the continuity developed in the bridge deck as opposed to the current Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) method of utilizing standardized spans treated as simply supported. This work consisted of a literature search and review, survey of other highway agencies, design comparisons, and cost-benefit analysis.

The design review consisted of comparisons of the standard design practices in terms of material use and cost from a review of electronically published design manuals, standards, and practices for state DOTs. Furthermore, the design review examined design cost, as determined by design hours spent to produce final bridge plans using the different design methodologies from state DOT survey respondents.

The cost-benefit analysis was based on construction costs from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) National Bridge Inventory (NBI) (with corrections to account for the different years the costs were recorded and the different regional bridge locations) and material and design costs from the design review.

Based on the evidence included in the final report for this project, the researchers concluded that simple span designs have a lower initial cost compared to continuous designs, in terms of construction cost and design time.

The lower construction cost demonstrated by the simple span designs in contradiction to theoretical material efficiencies in continuous design is an indicator that many of the continuous designs utilized are not optimized to the extent possible. While significant recent research has been completed on optimization methods for prestressed concrete bridge design, the majority of them remain undeveloped for practical application.

Due to the lack of strong evidence in favor of either design method in terms of long-term cost and performance, the research team concluded that simple span designs are preferable at this time.</abstract>

    <abstract>Structural supports for signs, luminaires, and traffic signals and other highway steel structures are generally galvanized to prevent corrosion and provide a long service life. However, recent investigations have revealed incidents of cracking in weldments of galvanized structures that appear to be induced during the galvanizing process. When placed in service, structures with such flaws will exhibit short service life and pose safety concerns. There is a need to identify the factors contributing to the occurrence of weldment cracking during the galvanizing process of steel highway structures and to propose improved design, materials, and construction specifications to help mitigate such cracking. This information will ensure that galvanized highway structures provide the intended service life and eliminate related safety concerns. The objective of this research is to propose improved design, materials, and construction specifications of galvanized steel highway structures to mitigate weldment cracking caused by the galvanizing process. This research is concerned with structural supports for signs, luminaires, and traffic signals and bridge superstructures (other than decks). Accomplishment of this objective will require at least the following tasks. Phase I: (1). Collect and review relevant domestic and foreign literature; research findings; and information relative to cracking of weldments in highway and other steel structures that may be attributed to galvanizing. This information may be obtained from published and unpublished reports, and contacts with transportation agencies and other public and private organizations.(2). Evaluate the information collected in Task 1, and identify the factors contributing to cracking of weldment in galvanized steel structures (e.g., galvanizing process, material properties and chemistry, and design details).(3). Assess the relevance of the factors identified in Task 2 to cracking of weldments in galvanized highway structures and the adequacy of existing specifications to identify and mitigate such cracking.(4). Based on the findings of Task 3, propose a plan that includes an experimental investigation, to be executed in Phase II, to develop improved design, materials, and construction specifications to mitigate cracking of weldments in galvanized highway structures. (5). Prepare an interim report that documents the research performed in Tasks 1 through 4. Following review of the interim report by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), the research team will be required to make a presentation to the project panel. Work on Phase II of the project will not begin until the interim report is approved and the Phase II work plan is authorized by the NCHRP. The decision on proceeding with Phase II will be based on the contractor's documented justification of the updated work plan. Phase II: (6). Execute the plan approved in Task 5. Based on this work propose improved design, material, and construction specifications for galvanized highway structures. (7). Prepare a final deliverable that documents the entire research effort. The proposed specifications shall be prepared as a stand-alone deliverable in a format suitable for consideration and adoption by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).</abstract>

    <abstract>The goal of this proposed research project is to provide a practical engineering solution to the end zone cracking problem. The main objective of the proposed research project is to provide the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Bridge Bureau with practical and experimentally verified end zone details, to minimize end zone cracking issues, prolong the service life and improve the durability of pretensioned concrete girders in Alabama.  The strain monitoring data will offer a unique opportunity to better understand the complex end zone behavior of pretensioned concrete girders.  The recommended long span girder design can not only be directly applied in future ALDOT bridge design practice, but also contribute to solving end zone cracking --- a nation-wide concern on implementing the structurally efficient design of long span deep girders.</abstract>

    <abstract>The results and analysis of the Icy Springs Bridge testing will yield insight into the deterioration of one of the first prestressed concrete bridges constructed in Utah. Built in 1965, the 54-foot long Icy Springs Bridge is composed of three double tee girders connected by several welded transverse connections similar to those found in parking structures. The bridge has sustained significant section loss and is posted at only 8 kips total load (traveling at 5 mph). Additionally, plans are not available. By understanding the behavior of this structure, similar structures can be treated in a similar manner and aid load rating engineers in the future.</abstract>

    <abstract>This research will determine the relative merits and design philosophy of several carbon fiber shear reinforcement schemes for pretensioned, prestressed concrete girders. The primary use of carbon fiber shear reinforcement would be in bridge girders prestressed with carbon fiber prestressing strands. This is done to provide a completely non-metallic reinforcement system, and , therefore, to provide for a longer girder life. The project will begin with a thorough literature and state-of-the-practice review. Based on this review, the three most promising reinforcement methods will be selected for further study. In addition, a design methodology for each reinforcement scheme will be developed. Square, reinforced concrete panels (mimicking the web area near the end of a full sized prestressed girder) will be fabricated with each of the three reinforcement methods so that a direct comparison of construction and design issues can be made. The panels will be tested in direct shear with load, deflections, and strains at critical locations continuously recorded. The behavior of the panels at both service load and strength will be observed and recorded. The project will conclude with developing fabrication and design recommendations for use by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and other state agencies.</abstract>

    <abstract>As asset management for bridges and other transportation structures progresses, an important challenge that must be addressed is the need to systematically determine the effect of damage/deterioration on structural performance, including issues related to safety and serviceability. Currently, bridges are primarily inspected visually and inspection findings are recorded using the American Association for State HIghway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) CoRe elements for use in bridge management programs such as AASHTOware Bridge Management (formerly Pontis). Although inspection findings are recorded by element type, the location of the damage on the element is not recorded. Without information on location, the ability to determine and document the significance of damage is limited. For example, a large corroded region on the flange of a simply supported steel girder would be of much greater concern if it were located near the middle of the span where the bending moment is high, than if it were located near the end of the span where moments are low. The need to track location information in order to assess the implications of damage to bridge performance is not a new revelation (e.g. Estes and Frangopol, 2003), but modern software tools are emerging that can enhance our ability to collect, store and use this type of information.
In a related issue, externally bonded fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) are increasingly being used as a repair technique for bridges, particularly reinforced and pre-stressed concrete bridges. FRP is applied in thin sheets, and can cover fairly large portions of some bridge elements. Mountain Plains Consortium (MPC) Project 340 considered the performance of externally bonded FRP after eight years in service on the Castlewood Canyon Bridge in Colorado (Atadero, Allen, and Mata, 2013). This project showed that regions of FRP are prone to debond from the concrete surface for reasons other than excessive loading such as environmental conditions and perhaps application techniques. As FRP becomes more common in the field, it becomes important to have means to record and track the condition of these debonded regions (i.e., location information) in order to 1) better understand the sources of initiation and rates of progression of debonding, and 2) to be able to assess how the debonding is affecting structural condition. Understanding FRP debonding is another situation where it is important to track damage with regard to specific locations on structures. For example, if 5% of the total area of FRP is debonded, but this area is distributed throughout the total bonded region in many small areas, this would be much less concerning that a situation where all 5% was concentrated in a single critical location.
In both cases, a means is needed to record and store the location and extent of damage/deterioration on bridge elements and to provide a platform for analysis of the recorded damage. Such a tool could be used to assess the actual condition of the structure or element. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers a great deal of promise to support the creation of such a tool(s). The three-dimensional (3D) interface of BIM software creates a platform that enables engineers to visualize and explore geometric relationships virtually and in real-time. The real power of BIM, however, comes from the association of databases (for example, information about loads, tributary area, reactions, moments, shears, and beam sizes) with 3D information, allowing previously unavailable queries, filters and analysis. Specifically, organizing data within three dimensions allows for software analysis that incorporates and relates locational information, creating new opportunities for data storage, manipulation and output. Finally, interoperable capabilities that support data transfer between BIM software and existing analysis programs (for example, Revit Architecture and Robot Structural Analysis) can further support accurate and automated data analysis. In sum, significant opportunity exists to use BIM models to transform structural asset management of bridges and a wide range infrastructure facilities (Clevenger, Ozbek, Fanning and Mahmoud, forthcoming).
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using BIM models to store detailed
data from bridge inspections (particularly with respect to location and extent of damage), and to
develop a preliminary analysis tool that can operate on the enhanced data stored in the BIM
model to provide assessments of structural condition.
The objectives of this research are to:
(1) Collect detailed data on bridge condition from a real bridge and show how this data can be
input and stored in a BIM model of the structure; 
(2) Develop a demonstration analysis tool that can take the information stored about element
condition and assess the effect of recorded damage on structural performance (in terms of
strength, for example). This demonstration tool will operate on a specific type of bridge element
� likely the girders or deck; and
(3) Identify the future research and tools needed to make the process of storing bridge inspection
results in BIM practical for state departments of transportation (DOTs).</abstract>

    <abstract>The aim of the project proposed as part of the RE-CAST effort is to develop a new generation of high-performance concrete (HPC) that has relatively low binder content and low risk of cracking. Such concrete is intended for pavement construction and cast-in-place bridge elements to secure greater service life. Two types of HPC-AR are targeted, as follows: (1) environmentally friendly concrete for pavement construction (Eco-Pave-Crete); (2) environmentally friendly concrete for bridge decks and transportation infrastructure construction (Eco-Bridge-Crete). The Eco-Bridge-Crete will be designed with different workability levels to facilitate construction operations and reduce labor and cost.</abstract>

    <abstract>Accelerated bridge construction (ABC) projects are becoming more commonplace and often critical to bridge designers and contractors meeting the needs and demands of the traveling public. Through the development of various ABC designs and techniques, several technologies have been important for accelerating the process or to provide for greater bridge sustainability. At the same time, significant steps have been made in improving bridge durability by moving towards bridges with integral abutments. However, to date, the two have not been paired together for ABC and, in general, integral abutments have seen limited (if any) use in ABC despite widespread use in typical bridge construction for decades. Development of an integral abutment design utilizing grouted couplers has the potential to make bridges constructed using ABC techniques more efficient, economical, and increase service life by eliminating expansion joints. Furthermore, these designs will allow all the benefits conventional bridges with integral abutments have realized to be transferred and applied to ABC projects. In addition to the integral abutment design using grouted couplers, there is a need for more information regarding the strength and durability of the grouted rebar coupler in these specific applications. Testing and validating these characteristics, in a capacity directly related to ABC projects and integral abutments, would ensure ABC bridges constructed using these technologies meet or exceed the strength and serviceability requirements of their cast-in-place counterparts. The focus of this project is to expand on work currently ongoing to further understand the strength and durability characteristics of grouted couplers for use in ABC projects, specifically, integral abutments for ABC projects. In addition, to investigate other means for developing an integral abutment connection suitable for ABC projects. To accomplish this, developed details for integral abutments utilizing grouted couplers and other connection details will be constructed and evaluated through laboratory testing.</abstract>

    <abstract>The main objective in constructing bridges with the accelerated bridge construction (ABC) philosophy is to place the bridge in service rapidly and therefore minimize traffic interruption. At the same time, the design of bridges for service life is gaining more importance as limited resources demand enhancing the service life of existing and new bridges. The main objective of this project is to develop a manual devoted to enhancing service life ABC projects. The development of the document will consider the ABC projects nationwide. The factors that impact service life will be identified and strategies will be developed to mitigate them. It will include case studies, examples, design, inspection and maintenance information. It will be flexible and accommodating to the addition of new information as it becomes available. Tools will be developed to assist the user to navigate through the information and make the document user friendly. The general framework for the document will be similar to that described in the Guide for Design of Bridges for Service Life (Azizimini et.al.).</abstract>

    <abstract>The steel bridge system referred to as Simple for Dead load and Continuous for Live load (SDCL) has gained popularity in non-seismic areas of the country. Accordingly, it results in many advantages including enhanced service life and lower inspection and maintenance costs as compared to conventional steel systems. To-date, no research studies have been carried out to evaluate the behavior of the SDCL steel bridge system in high seismic areas. The main objective of this research is to extend the application of SDCL to high seismic areas. This project is Phase I of an envisioned effort that will culminate in the development of a set of details and associated design provisions to develop a version of the SDCL steel bridge system, suitable for high seismic application.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this project is to develop a novel methodology to determine live/dynamic load impact factors on long-span steel truss railroad bridges caused by modern high-speed trains. The methodology will be based on analytic formulation, finite element modeling, and field testing on a real bridge. The results from the project work should contribute significantly to improving railroad safety and reduce the costs of upgrading existing railroad bridge structures to accommodate high-speed rail service, predict remaining life, improve the rating of such structures, and increase structure safety and reliability. The products of the project should, are expected to be highly relevant to railroads, state departments of transportation, and industries dealing with railroad bridge design, construction, and maintenance.</abstract>

    <abstract>A cost-effective bridge is a bridge whose maintenance is based on its chemical condition over it's entire service life.  If deterioration mechanisms are prevented, a bridge would cost considerably less to maintain and safely serves its full design service life, if not longer.  The current practice for physical evaluation and delayed maintenance of deteriorated concrete bridges is fundamentally wrong.  The current inspection manuals are primarily focused on detecting physical damage in concrete bridge elements.  If no physical damage is detected, very minimal maintenance actions are taken.  This is the main reason why the number of United States (US) bridges that are classified structurally deficient is on the rise.  Given the need for future expansion of the US transportation network and increase in number of new bridges, there is a need for cost-effective maintenance process that prevents deterioration mechanism from starting, or at least stops it at a very early stage.</abstract>

    <abstract>Adjacent box-beams need to work together for a bridge to function effectively as a single unit. Structural performance of non-composite box-beam bridges is greatly dependent on the shear key, the connection details including the grout, waterproofing, and the tie rods. Severe leakage is commonly documented. Water leakage leads to premature aging and is the primary cause for corrosion of the prestressing strands and non-prestressed steel, which causes spalling and snapping of strands. 

Prevention of water leakage is critical to minimize corrosion related deterioration at the longitudinal joints of adjacent box-beams. Any cracking along the joints and differential deflection of adjacent beams causes water proofing membrane to get damaged making water leakage inevitable. Most times the seeping water is contaminated with chloride from deicing materials which makes the concrete susceptible to corrosion related damage such as cracking and spalling.

This project is being conducted in collaboration with Ohio's Research Initiative for Locals (ORIL). This research was initiated by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to establish the sources, causes and effects of inadequate waterproofing at joints and develop preventive measures through careful evaluation of alternatives on the state system. The scope of work was expanded to incorporate aspects specific to the local system such as: (1) analysis of adjacent precast reinforced concrete box-beams to establish the sources, causes and effects of inadequate waterproofing at the joints; (2) an evaluation of peel-and-stick waterproofing as a membrane alternative, (3) an analysis of grouting options/alternatives for keyway joints; and (4) develop preventive measures for existing and new box-beam bridges. The results of this research will provide a basis for better preparation of local officials to deal with system degradation of these structure types and maintenance of existing structures in addition to providing an opportunity for improvements in planning and design of new structures.          </abstract>

    <abstract>The United States civil infrastructure is aging and has been identified as an area in critical need. American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that the current deterioration trends can have disastrous consequences in terms of costs ($520 billion by year 2040), and socioeconomic impact (loss of ~400,000 jobs nationwide). In 2009, approximately 25% of bridge fleet in the US was identifies as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Majority of them are typical bridges, consisting of a concrete deck supported by steel girders (stringers). It is evident that sustainable preservation of existing infrastructure represents a goal that is essential for future vitality of the US economy and the prosperity of the US society. With an aging infrastructure, it becomes crucial to make informed decisions about maintenance and preservation actions and renewal. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) can be an important aid in this decision process, but in spite of its great potential, SHM is not applied in a widespread or generic manner, which is essentially due to the lack of reliable and affordable monitoring solutions. Thus, there is a demand for monitoring methods that are not specific to individual structure, are reliable and robust onsite, and applicable to typical bridges. These methods were successfully researched within the first term of the UTC; however new challenges were identified.</abstract>

    <abstract>The structural integrity of railroad infrastructure is critical in order to address structural repair needs in a timely fashion and ensure rail safety. This includes the regular inspection and maintenance of railroad tunnel linings and timber beams and ties. Since tunnels are naturally in an aggressive environment that is not conducive to lane closures, early detection that leads to preventive maintenance is a necessity. The occurrence of damage and deterioration in railroad timber beams and ties can lead to failure of the components and, in the worst case, derailment of the train. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, wide gages due to defective/missing cross ties accounted for the highest percentage (17.1%) of all railway accidents in the US from 2008-2011 (FRA, 2011). It is therefore crucial to detect damage at an early stage so that, by taking appropriate measures, failure can be prevented. The proposed project will examine the use of Ultrasonic Tomography (UST) to examine the interior of wooden beams and cross ties as well as railroad tunnel linings on-site. The Ultrasonic Tomographer employs a matrix (4x12) of low-frequency, shear transducers that generate shear waves through the depth of a specimen under test. The waves are reflected by internal discontinuities and changes in medium (such as concrete, air, and steel). This behavior is utilized to map voids, delamination, cracks, and other defects, as well as structural depth and reinforcement presence. The waves are sequentially emitted and received by 66 paired transducers per single scan, causing repeated reflections and patterns to stand out for inspection. Through the use of dry-point-contact piezoelectric sensors, the transducers do not require the use of a coupling agent, making it practical for on-site applications. The recorded signals undergo automated signal processing to identify the existence, location, and size of the potential discontinuities. The UST technique can be used to map entire three dimensional (3D) images of concrete sections as well as single-point evaluations.</abstract>

    <abstract>Various maintenance treatments are employed by highway agencies to slow deterioration and restore condition of highway pavements, bridges, and other physical assets. However, budget constraints and other factors have often led to delaying or eliminating the application of these treatments. Such actions are expected to adversely influence the condition and performance and lead to a reduced level of service, to early deterioration, and eventually to the need for costly rehabilitation or replacement.   
Analytical tools are currently available to quantify the consequences of delayed application of maintenance treatments for highway pavements, bridges, and other assets. However, processes for using these tools to demonstrate the potential savings and performance enhancements resulting from applying maintenance treatments at the right time are not readily available. Research is needed to develop such processes. This information will help highway agencies better assess the economic benefits of maintenance actions and their role in enhancing the level of service of the highway system. In addition, incorporating these processes in asset management systems would provide a means for optimizing the allocation of resources. Recent work completed under National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 14-20 provided further review of some of the issues related to quantifying the consequences of delayed application of maintenance treatments and identified processes applicable to pavements and bridges. However, additional research is needed to address these and other issues associated with delayed maintenance treatments, particularly for assets other than bridges and pavements, and to develop processes for quantifying the consequences of such delays and help assess the economic benefits of maintenance actions. The objective of this research was to develop processes for quantifying the consequences of delayed application of maintenance treatments on highway pavements, bridges, and other physical assets. The research expressed consequences in terms of performance indicators (e.g., distress and level of service), costs to owners and road users, and other relevant factors and defined delayed maintenance applications by (1) the inability to meet the agency-defined application schedule or (2) the available budget relative to an unconstrained budget (i.e., availability of the funds required to perform all needed maintenance).  Research is complete; the final report has been published as NCHRP Research Report 859, Consequences of Delayed Maintenance of Highway Assets.</abstract>

    <abstract>Many departments of transportation (DOTs) have aging bridges that have been in their inventory that they are responsible for maintenance and replacement.  Furthermore, many of the older bridges have exceeded the design life.  To complicate the issue, design plans for many of the older bridges simply do not exist and make the need of replacement even more pressing due to the uncertainty of the bridge.  However, replacement is difficult do to limited budgets and excessive needs.  As such, DOTs do not have the experience or data to draw upon to decide whether the bridges need to be replaced.  A unique opportunity to test a full scale double tee concrete bridge that was one of the first prestressed bridges built in the state of Utah has become available.  Very little information exists on double tee bridge girders that have been in service for an extended period of time.  The information gained from testing this bridge will provide valuable data on the performance of double tee concrete bridges that have been subjected to severe corrosion and quantify their flexure and shear capacities.  This data will help Department of Transportation agencies make better informed maintenance decisions.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study will update Synthesis 254, Service Life of Drainage Pipe (1996), which in turn updated National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Synthesis 50, Durability of Drainage Pipe (1978). The culvert industry and research community has produced in the last 15 years significant developments in plastic pipe, fiber-reinforced concrete pipe, polymeric-coated metal pipe, recycled materials, larger and more diverse structures, and sophisticated analytical soil-structure interaction modeling. As such, there is a growing need for a new study of the service life of culverts. For the purposes of this study, service life is the time duration during which a culvert is expected to provide the desired function with a specified level of maintenance established at the design or retrofit stage.  The selection of alternate culvert or materials for a particular site is based on the material's ability to satisfy the requirements of five selection criteria: (1) Structural design, (2) Hydraulic design, (3) Environmental and site considerations, (4) Joint performance, and (5) Service life (durability).  Significant published works provide guidance for the first three criteria and NCHRP Project 15-38 and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 20-07 Task 347 address joint performance. Service life is the remaining criterion that will be addressed by this synthesis study. No consensus exists among the state departments of transportation (DOTs) on the definition of service life and/or the required time frame of service. Predictive models are often parameterized to specific geographic and environmental considerations. Design service lives range from 15 to 100 years based most often on site conditions, traffic volume, or functional classification of roadways. Material service life models developed for different pipe materials are inconsistent and do not relate to limit state (failure mode) or service distresses adversely affecting both structural and hydraulic performance, including cold-weather induced distresses.  The following information will be gathered and synthesized: (1) The required service life for the culvert in varying conditions, including the basis for determining the service life (e.g. average daily traffic (ADT), accessibility, cost of future repair) and any additional design parameters based on the service life. (e.g. oversizing for slip-lining). This will include considerations of maintenance. (2) The conditions constituting the end of useful service life for various culvert installations, including but not limited to materials, soil/backfill properties, hydraulic performance, and appurtenances. (3) The time for a particular material to reach the end of its useful service life, and (4) Information on the how the following are correlated and/or implemented-  a. Material service life, and b. Culvert failure limit states  This synthesis final report will do the following: (1) Update NCHRP Synthesis 254, Service Life of Drainage Pipe; (2) Build upon the significant start of AASHTO 20-07 Task 264, Guidance for Design and Selection of Pipes; (3) Review AASHTO/DOT, TRB/NCRHP, industry, and other published literature for methodologies used to establish service life and material service life; (4) Provide definitions of the end of useful service life for culvert materials in a rational and implementable form; (5) Provide a catalog of models for determining service life of culvert materials; (6) Provide an example of how the material in the report might be used to predict service life of a hypothetical culvert selection; and (7) Identify gaps in knowledge and future research needs, which may include preparation of a formal NCHRP research problem statement.  Information will be gathered by literature review and survey of state transportation agencies, including Canadian provinces.(See NCHRP 10-86 for possible survey recipients). An initial screening survey will be sent to the AASHTO Highway Subcommittee on Maintenance to determine who are the most appropriate recipients (100% response is required).</abstract>

    <abstract>Of the over 605,000 bridges in the U.S., about 12% are structurally deficient and another 16% are functionally obsolete (FHWA 2012). Three out of four structurally deficient bridges have major problems with their decks. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop innovative modular high performance lightweight deck options that lend themselves to accelerated bridge construction (ABC). Such bridge decks would allow an increase in the load rating of existing bridges and accordingly improve their functionality and service life. The lightweight bridge deck would also allow widening of existing bridges without placing additional dead weight on their substructure. Given the primary objective of the National Center for Transportation Systems Productivity and Management (NCTSPM) (i.e., to improve the productivity and management of the U.S. Transportation System in an accountable and measurable way), and the fact that constrained resources are the greatest barrier to achieving this objective, the proposed research addresses two of the fundamental three questions of the 2014-15 solicitation; How do we get most out of the existing transportation systems? And how should we build for the future? The proposed bridge deck systems improve the state of good repair in bridge infrastructure throughout the U.S., thereby improving public safety on their daily commute. This will lead to the next generation transportation infrastructure, which is the first defined NCTSPM research area, as these systems address the fundamental issue of maintenance of existing bridge decks, an ongoing challenge with almost every transportation agency in the U.S. The proposed deck options also address durability of deteriorating infrastructure in constant need of rehabilitation. The innovative lightweight bridge decks will be modularized and prefabricated with highest quality control and quality assurance during the manufacturing process. The systems would integrate advanced construction materials, including ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), high-strength steel (HSS), and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), as appropriate. The systems would also provide options for different arrangements of superstructure, including different girder spacing.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this research is to produce a limited set of performance measures and analysis tools that states, local governments, and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), can use to better understand and communicate the costs and benefits of pavement and bridge infrastructure preservation activities which restore facility condition and extend the service life. The measures and tools should reflect the impacts of preservation investments on lifecycle costs, and impacts on system users.   The set of measures should be designed to inform agency decision making as well as to educate the public on the impact of preservation investments. There are numerous efforts underway to measure the condition and performance of the transportation system. Research is also ongoing to develop performance based planning and programming processes. Historically, most measures of infrastructure health have focused on the condition of pavement and bridges, and measuring end conditions such as the percentage of structurally deficient bridges and percentage of smooth pavement. As states more fully implement dynamic asset management systems that measure a broad set of infrastructure health indices, they are able to improve the cost effectiveness of their of their investments--and to more specifically target investments to meet desired preservation goals. Preservation activities are intended to maximize the life of an asset and minimize the life cycle cost to maintain the asset by preventing deterioration of the asset to a state where replacement or extensive rehabilitation of core structural elements is required. Ideally, preservation activities should be performed as close as practical to the end of the "window of opportunity" and before more costly work becomes necessary. Current infrastructure performance measures are largely focused on measuring infrastructure end conditions, and not on measuring the specific benefits from implementing a preservation investment strategy. Devoting additional resources to system preservation, however, means that less funding is available in the short term for more costly replacement or reconstruction projects. With increasing funding constraints at all levels of government, transportation asset owners would benefit from a set of performance measures that can clearly relate the life cycle costs of preservation investments to the benefits derived from these investments.</abstract>

    <abstract>Structural Health Monitoring has become a viable solution to continuously monitor critical infrastructure components that show distress or are unable to pass current load rating procedures. This research focuses on the development of a structural sensing composite layer for concrete structures that is capable of providing distributed monitoring capability. The layer consists of carbon nanotubes that are deposited on a carrier, which form a continuous conductive skin that is extremely sensitive to changes in strain and the formation and propagation of microdamage and macrodamage. It can be either loadbearing, i.e. the layer represents the reinforcement as well as the sensor, or nonloadbearing, i.e. the layer acts as a sensing skin alone. Distributed sensing allows for increased detectability of forming or growing defects that cannot necessarily be captured with conventional point-type sensors, such as strain gauges or accelerometers.

    <abstract>Steel bridges are considered to have a superior performance under earthquakes when compared to their reinforced concrete counterpart. Such reputation stems from the fact that few steel bridges have been subjected to strong ground motion in the last decade in North America. In addition to the lack of seismic exposure of the bridges, research on the seismic performance of steel bridges' superstructure is limited to few studies. Under very large inelastic strain cycles, the bridge components could fail and threaten the integrity of the bridge. Materials undergoing very large strain can only withstand a small number of reverse loading cycles, which is termed ultra - low cycle fatigue (ULCF). The stress range in High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) characterizes the behavior when the material is subjected to stress level below the yield stress. Under the HSF mechanism, small strain increment will result in relatively larger change in stress and therefore, it is appropriate to describe the behavior using the Stress - Number of cycles approach. Conventional Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) is used to characterize the response when the stress range close to or slightly beyond the yield point; therefore the Strain - Number of cycles curve might more applicable in this case. The Manson - Coffin equation describing the LCF behavior is currently the most popular and acceptable among different model.  The objectives of the project are to: (1) collect experimental data on the fatigue response of CFRP - repaired RC girders under various service temperatures.; (2) develop finite element models for fatigue life predictions of the girders.; and (3) recommend best repair practice for increasing the fatigue life of the repaired girders.</abstract>

    <abstract>Road infrastructure in the United States (US) is aging rapidly as many roads are approaching or exceeding their design life. As a result, transportation agencies need to allocate more resources to maintenance and rehabilitation (M&amp;amp;R) activities. The National Highway System (NHS) spent 48.5 percent of its total capital spending in 2008 in system rehabilitation, the highest percentage since 2000. On the other hand, stringent budgets provide insufficient funding to support all needed M&amp;amp;R projects. Decision makers have to prioritize and select projects based on their tangible benefits to the transportation system. Meanwhile, traffic congestion across the country has been on the rise over the past 30 years by every measure. The problem is further exacerbated by an increasing number of M&amp;amp;R projects performed on already-congested roads. Work zones are estimated to account for nearly 24% of non-recurring delay on freeways. Hence, M&amp;amp;R project selection and scheduling not only are essential to restore and maintain a reasonable level of service on existing roads but also have profound impact on congestion mitigation. The objectives of this project are to: (1) explicitly capture the impacts of the presence of multiple M&amp;amp;R projects on travelers' route choice behavior; and (2) strategically select and schedule M&amp;amp;R projects in a transportation network over a finite planning horizon to maximize social benefit.</abstract>

    <abstract>Advanced composite materials (ACM), also known as fiber-reinforced composite materials, have increasingly been used in civil engineering applications.  Their primary use in civil engineering applications to date has concentrated on rehabilitation of existing structures or in applications prone to corrosion damage.  ACM's have properties that make them attractive for use in a variety of other applications that have not been fully exploited to date. For this reason, The New England Transportation Consortium (NETC) has conducted two research projects to date to identify those applications within the transportation infrastructure in New England where ACM's could replace traditional materials used in civil engineering.  The primary objective of NETC 01-1 was to identity obstacles for the widespread use of ACM's in New England's transportation infrastructure as a first step to promote their broader use.  The research project report for NETC 01-1 can be found at:  http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/netc/netcr62_01-1.pdf. NETC 01-1-T2: Phase I was subsequently conducted to identify and select an application for which ACM's offered a rational alternative to traditionally used materials with the goal of eliminating observed problems caused by the use of traditional materials.   The objective was to select a prototype application that could be competitively fabricated and installed in the transportation infrastructure throughout New England.  The prototype that was selected as an outcome of NETC 01-1-T2; Phase I was to develop a standard drain system that could be used throughout bridges in New England to eliminate the problems with corrosion and leakage that occurs when using traditional materials, and to extend the service life of bridge drains.  Selection of this prototype was achieved through a series of meetings held at transportation agencies throughout New England and consensus among members of the technical committee for the project. The research project report for NETC 01-1-T2 can be found at: http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/netc/netcr77_01-1_t2.pdf. The objective of the current research project is to fabricate and install (implement) the prototype selected in Phase I described above in representative field applications within New England. The main objectives of the project are: (1) Design and fabricate a standard drain that can be produced economically for use throughout New England bridges. (2) Install the fabricated drain system in 2 to 3 representative bridge applications in New England to provide information on its performance, ease of construction, and cost.</abstract>

    <abstract>Development of a multimetric sensing system and data interpretation procedures for determining damage identification and quantification dramatically transform the economics of bridge preservation/management and improve the serviceability of bridges. The system will consist of a network of low-cost sensors attached to critical bridge components. Each sensor node is self-powered and capable of continuously monitoring and storing the dynamic strain, acceleration, and frequency response in the host structure.

    <abstract>A previous research project carried out by Cleveland State University investigated the occurrence of wide-spread premature cracking of bridge concrete parapets on relatively recently constructed bridge decks. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) District 12 had identified 27 bridges exhibiting premature cracking of bridge concrete parapets to varying degrees. Bridge concrete parapets can be replaced without bridge deck replacement, and the decks on which these problem parapets were poured appeared to be performing as anticipated. A cursory review of District 12 parapets showed little correlation between deck characteristics; some were on short spans, while others were on longer spans and/or skews. Also, multiple contractors and concrete suppliers were involved. The District did replace one cracked parapet (without replacing the deck) and the cost was about $140,000. Cracked parapets are a safety concern and the potential cost to the Department to remove and replace parapets could be significant. The overall objective of the study was to determine the reasons for uncontrolled bridge deck parapet cracking, and to provide recommendations to ODOT to prevent such cracking in the future. This previous project identified the most likely causes of premature bridge parapet cracking. On the basis of the previous work, ODOT District 12 has decided to investigate some of the alternatives suggested by the research by conducting field tests on construction projects. This project would seek to develop improved parapet designs to mitigate cracking, and monitor test sites constructed in the field during the summer of 2013 and/or 2014. This proposed research relates to ODOT's mission of "Take care of what we have." It directly addresses the Strategic Focus Research Area of Transportation Asset Management. This represents an example of "Developing methods to better utilize resources and integrate advances in science, technology, and construction techniques." It will also enhance Transportation Safety because deteriorated parapet material could potentially represent a risk to the traveling public. The significance of this work is that uncontrolled concrete bridge parapet cracking has cost ODOT significant expenditures, and this trend is expected to continue in the future unless a solution can be found. Bridge deck parapets are replaced when it is necessary to replace the bridge deck itself as they sit on top of the deck and are constructed after the deck. District 12 had to replace the parapet on a bridge over I-271 in 2002 at a cost of $139,705.75 which did not include sealing, fence and expansion joint repairs. So, if the parapet were to need replaced prior to the deck, that cost is wasted when the deck is ultimately replaced. Overall, the project is likely to result in higher durability, longer service life, reduced life cycle cost, and reduced disruption to the traveling public.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridges constructed with adjacent precast prestressed concrete box beams have been in service for many years and provide an economical solution for short and medium span bridges. A recurring problem is cracking in the longitudinal grouted joints between adjacent beams, resulting in reflective cracks forming in the asphalt wearing surface or concrete deck. The cracking appears to be initiated by stresses caused by temperature gradients, live loads, transverse post-tensioning, or a combination. Once the cracking has occurred, chloride-laden water can penetrate the cracks and cause corrosion of the reinforcement and prestressing strand. National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Synthesis 39: Adjacent Precast Concrete Box Beam Bridges: Connection Details reported a wide variety of practices used by state highway agencies for the connection details between adjacent box beams. These practices include partial depth or full depth grouted keyways, keyways grouted before or after transverse post-tensioning, prepackaged or non-prepackaged grout materials, post-tensioned or non-tensioned transverse ties, a wide range of applied transverse post-tensioning forces, and cast-in-place concrete decks or no decks. A few states reported that their methods had reduced the longitudinal cracking, whereas others had not been successful using similar methods. Research to evaluate those practices at the design and construction phases can lead to connection details that prevent cracking and leakage at the joints and extend the service life of the adjacent box beam bridges. The objective of this research is to develop guidelines for the design and construction of connection details for adjacent precast concrete box beam bridges to eliminate cracking and leakage in the longitudinal joints between adjacent boxes. The research will produce proposed design and construction specifications with commentary in the format of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Specifications. Accomplishment of the project objective will require at least the following tasks. PHASE I--Planning - (1). Conduct a critical review of relevant specifications, technical literature, and owner and industry experiences. The review should cover research findings from both domestic and foreign sources. (2). Propose analytical and testing programs to investigate cracking in the longitudinal grouted joints between adjacent beams. As a minimum, the following factors should be considered: (i) design methodology; (ii) effect of span length; (iii) bridge width; (iv) skew angle; (v) number and location (both vertically and horizontally) of transverse post-tensioning ties; (vi) differential camber; (vii) optimum keyway shape and configuration; (viii) keyway preparation; (ix) keyway grout type and curing methods; and (x) grouting and post-tensioning sequence for two-stage construction. The testing program should cover the design of laboratory specimens to be tested in Phase III. The design should consider the scale effect and testing configurations on the accuracy of the results. (3). Prepare Interim Report No. 1 that documents Tasks 1 and 2 and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project. This report is due no later than 3 months after the contract award. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases II through V. PHASE II--Analytical Program - (4). Execute the approved work plan for the analytical program. (5). Identify proposed areas of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications that may require modification.  (6). Finalize the testing program to validate the findings of the analytical program. (7). Prepare Interim Report No. 2 that documents Tasks 4 through 6 and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project. This report is due no later than 9 months after approval of Phase I. The updated plan must describe the work proposed for Phases III through V. PHASE III--Testing Program and Analytical Program Validation - (8). Execute the testing program according to the approved work plan.( 9). Validate and finalize the analytical program based on test results.(10). Prepare Interim Report No. 3 that documents Tasks 8 and 9 of Phase III no later than 12 months after approval of Phase II.  PHASE IV-- Proposed Modifications to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications - (11). Based on the analytical and testing investigations, develop specification and commentary language for proposed changes to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications supported with examples. (12). Quantify the potential economic impact of the proposed revisions.(13). Prepare Interim Report No. 4 that documents Tasks 11 and 12 of Phase IV no later than 6 months after approval of Phase III.  PHASE V--Final Products - (14). Update proposed modifications to the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications after consideration of review comments and prepare ballot items for AASHTO Highway Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures consideration.(15). Prepare a final report that documents the entire research effort.</abstract>

    <abstract>Significant resources are being applied by public and private road and rail organizations to design and construct restored streams in disturbed watersheds as well as to provide for stable transportation crossings (bridges and culverts) of streams. Lacking in this effort is a scientifically supported method for defining the design hydrology for such efforts along with an understanding of how that design hydrology might change with land use changes. For natural stream watercourses, the morphology of the principal channel has been believed to be related to a comparatively frequent flood discharge. Fundamentally, the product of net sediment transport at a given flow rate and the frequency of occurrence of that flow rate is not monotonic, but achieves an extremum for some relatively frequent value. That value is called "dominant discharge" or "effective discharge." Some authors draw subtle distinctions between these two terms, but both are founded on the assumption that the geomorphology of the stream is an artifact of the dominant sediment transport processes. This discharge is often considered to be approximately represented in hydraulic geometry by the bankfull stage. The bankfull stage is the depth that occurs in the main channel before spilling over into the floodplain. Current thinking is that the recurrence interval of this flow is thought to vary somewhat across the United States, but in many studies the discharge at bankfull stage has been considered to be approximately a 2-year event or more frequent based on an annual peak flow series. Wolman and Miller (1960) have shown that for a variety of American rivers located in different climatic and physiographic regions, 90% of the sediment load is carried by events with less than a 5-year return period. Regardless of nomenclature associated with particular authors, it is evident that channel forming discharges correspond to flood-frequency return periods of less than 5 years. However, the focus on defining a design discharge based on traditional return period analysis of annual peak discharges has not proven successful. There is a need to look at the flow-duration curve to characterize the range of flows experienced by a channel and to identify how the flow-duration curve or key points on that curve may be used to derive design hydrology. In addition, much stream restoration and stream stability work is performed at sites were the upstream watershed is experiencing land-use changes. These changes, in turn, not only affect peak discharges but also the flow-duration curves. Discharges with recurrence intervals of 5 years or less are typically most significantly affected by land-use change such as urbanization, surface mining, removal of trees, and varying agriculture practices. In addition to peak flow values, considerable changes to flow duration relationships and total runoff volume can occur with changes in watershed character. For example, conventional wisdom is that urbanization usually involves the clearing of natural vegetation and replacement with impervious cover such as rooftops, roadways, parking lots, and sidewalks and increases the volume of flood runoff. Furthermore, "improved" stream channels through straightening or lining, curb-and-gutter streets and storm drains or sewers are thought to cause more rapid and dramatic watershed response to particular storm characteristics. Sauer and others (1983) showed that impervious cover of 30% and moderate engineered alteration of stream channels would approximately double the magnitude of discharge associated with a 2-year recurrence interval. Such increases in flow rate and flow volume imply related increases in net sediment transport potential. Conversely, diminished magnitude of frequent flows may result from a number of anthropogenic activities. Agricultural water conservation activities such as contour plowing, terracing, pumping from valley alluvium, and structural control such as flood control and water supply reservoirs can all result in dramatic reduction in both peak flow rate and flow duration associated with frequent events. The net result of diminishing flow would obviously be a reduction in net sediment transport potential and sediment throughput. Either increases or decreases in net sediment transport potential imply some similar change in the character of channel-forming discharge, consequently affecting both geometry and stability of existing stream channels. Many watersheds are affected by the land-use change. Changes in the character of frequently occurring event hydrographs imply that changes will also occur in the net sediment transport rates out of a watershed and in available stream power. The effects of these changes are unknown, but are thought to imply potential changes in-state of sediment throughput relationships. Research is needed to quantify the effects of land-use change on the channel forming discharges and resulting channel geometry that are important in designing culverts and bridges for long-term performance. The evolution of the stream channel is important to the design of culverts and bridges. If the stage-discharge curve of a bridge or culvert rises significantly more rapidly than the adjacent stream reach, stream power is diminished and local aggradation of the stream often occurs, reducing the effectiveness of the stream and the structure. If the stage-discharge curve of the structure does not rise as rapidly as that of the stream, it may serve as an obstruction, resulting in increased channel velocities and stream power that may lead to local stream degradation and instability. As a result, many state departments of transportation (DOTs) are designing these hydraulic structures to be consistent with bankfull or effective discharges. To obtain permits for highway construction, highway agencies are being required, by environmental agencies, to design stream restoration projects. The long-term hydrology of these designs has not been investigated, resulting in a weak link in protecting highway infrastructure from the effects of stream instability. This is especially significant in designing for bridge scour, the leading cause of bridge failures around the nation. The objective of this research is to develop a scientifically supported method for defining the design hydrology for such efforts along with an understanding of how that design hydrology might change with land-use changes. Steps to produce that methodology include the following: (1) Investigate flow metrics other than peak annual flood frequency curves for more consistent correlation with channel forming processes (such as distribution of daily mean discharge, flow duration, key points on a flow-duration curve, etc); (2) Develop quantitative methods for estimating the impact of land-use change on the design metric that is appropriate for design; and (3) Investigate the connection between these changes and changes in channel-forming discharge, and consequently bankfull channel hydraulic geometry. These methods should include changes due to urbanization, surface mining, agriculture, and forestry practices.</abstract>

    <abstract>As truck weights and volumes increase and the bridge infrastructure ages, owners have a vital need to access quality truck and load performance data for bridge management and operations decision-making purposes. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of truck traffic on bridge performance.  This multi-year study will collect quality truck traffic and loads data (volumes, classifications, size, weights, and other relevant data) by installing, maintaining, calibrating, and utilizing instrumentation at selected bridge sites nationally, for the purpose of calibrating bridge specifications and quantifying load-induced deterioration of bridge elements and systems to establish bridge performance and serviceability criteria for improved long-term bridge performance, management and operations.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this research is to continuous monitor the stress changes in all external reinforcement to ensure the safety of the bridge structure.  This monitoring effort will provide the department on decision making on the future operation of the bridge.  In addition, since both the traditional steel reinforcement and Carbon Fiber Composite Cables (CFCC) will be used, comparisons of the long-term performance of the two materials will be made. Due to the corrosive environment of the subject bridge there is a concern of continuing deterioration of the bridge girders and to be installed reinforcing steel bars and CFCC's.  Continuous monitoring for the followings throughout the life time of this bridge is desirable, sudden change in stresses of the external reinforcing bars; gradual change in stresses of the external reinforcing bars and temperature. Any sudden increase in stresses of the internal reinforcement would indicate further deterioration of the prestressed girders either form spall of the concrete or breaking of the prestressed strands.  Conversely, any sudden decrease in stresses would indicate failure of the anchorage of the reinforcement rendering the repair ineffective. Gradual change in stresses is most likely to be related to creep or corrosion of the reinforcement.  Monitoring the change can provide insight into the behavior of the reinforcement.  In order to better isolate the change of stresses due to structural condition changes from environment, temperature will be recorded along with the stresses.</abstract>

    <abstract>As a national trend, Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are faced with difficult financial decisions.  The age of the infrastructure is increasing and deteriorating, needing maintenance and in some cases replacement.  This does not include the additional needs of infrastructure expansion due to the population increasing.  However, there simply is not enough money available to meet the required needs.  As a result judicious decisions need to be made based on accurate assessment of bridge performance. Bridge performance is dependent on many factors and therefore is often different than the assumed designed behavior.  Factors such as loading frequency and magnitude, load distribution, support conditions and environment are critical variables that can lead to changes in bridge performance. This proposed research will obtain the critical bridge performance factors by developing a self-contained, rapidly deployable data acquisition system that can be applied to a bridge and monitor the required data.  It is proposed that this system will be deployed on two bridges, one in the Commonwealth of Virginia and another in the State of Utah.  The data gathered from this system will be compared with comprehensive date gathered from comprehensive long-term data acquisition systems already deployed on the two bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Projects to repair and/or replace bridge deck joints have become increasingly problematic for the Iowa Department of Transportation. Joint failure has a variety of causes. Traffic counts have exceeded the original design projections for most bridges, especially with regard to heavy vehicles. Since the joints are slightly recessed into that pavement, dynamically induced forces occur as wheels drop into the slight joint recess. Therefore the joint and the surrounding concrete often receive the hardest pounding of any bridge component. Many bridge deck joints are located at the end of a bridge where uneven approach panels often amplify dynamically induced forces. Some joints are not sealed and water with dissolved winter maintenance chemicals seeps through the joints, corroding metal and compromising concrete. The combination of heavy traffic and harsh conditions often causes the concrete surrounding the joint to fail. Attempts to patch with concrete or asphalt provide only temporary relief and often do not restore the ride or seal the joint. Since the joint is often the first component of the bridge to fail, an attractive strategy for extending the life of the bridge is to repair or replace the joint. However such work is challenging because it must often be performed under traffic necessitating lane closures. The high traffic counts that helped to cause the joint failure make the possibilities of lane closures undesirable. The undesirability can be mitigated by shortening the repair time and concentrating construction efforts at low traffic times such as weekends and evenings. However, completing the repair quickly and with necessary quality can be challenging. Several steps are involved. The existing metal components of the joint and the surrounding concrete must be removed. Reinforcing steel is often interwoven with joint parts and some joint may include steel plate that may be up to two inches thick. Accommodations must be made to allow reinforcing the repaired section and the existing section of the bridge to tie together. The new metal components must be set to line and grade properly and tied into the reinforcing system. Concrete must be formed, placed, and cured to the point that it can stand the pounding of traffic. Completing such an entire operation quickly can be difficult. For the foregoing reasons, it would be desirable to develop improved methods to rapidly repair and replace bridge deck joints. The objective of this investigation is to develop a rapid, effective, and economical approach to repairing and replacing bridge deck joints.</abstract>

    <abstract>Visual bridge inspection of post-tensioning and stay cable systems is difficult because tendons are typically embedded in massive concrete (internal tendons) or opaque ducts (external tendons or stay cables). The current state of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technology has limitations for evaluating the condition of bridge post-tensioning and stay cable systems for corrosion, section loss, breakage, grout conditions, voids, water infiltration, and tendon deterioration in the anchorage systems. However, technologies and innovative applications continue to advance. NDE technologies from other industries may have potential for bridge condition assessments, and NDE technologies applied in combination may also provide opportunities not yet realized. Further investigation is warranted. Corrosion, section loss, and breakage have impacts in the form of reduced safety and load capacity, costly rehabilitation actions, and traffic disruption. Therefore, condition assessments of post-tensioning and stay cable systems could allow bridge owners to take timely, proactive actions to mitigate or prevent further deterioration and unanticipated failure. The population of structures containing post-tensioning and stay cable systems continues to grow and age. Therefore, condition assessments of these systems are critical for maintaining public safety. The objective of this research is to develop inspection guidelines to assist bridge owners in selecting the most appropriate NDE method or combination of methods for assessing the condition of in-service post-tensioning and stay cable systems common in U.S. application. As a minimum, the inspection guide shall consider duct type and address the following conditions: corrosion, section loss, breakage, grout conditions, voids, water infiltration, and tendon deterioration in the anchorage systems and other difficult areas to inspect such as diaphragms and deviators, cable saddles, and inside strand bundles. In order to select the most appropriate NDE method for assessing a particular condition, multiple NDE technologies shall be considered and evaluated against a set of applicable and repeatable metrics to be developed under this research and tested using mock-up specimens. Accomplishment of the project objective will require at least the following tasks: Phase I--Synthesis on condition assessment of post-tensioning and stay cable systems using NDE methods - Task 1. Review relevant literature, ongoing research findings, and current practices to assess the condition of post-tensioning and stay cable systems using state-of-the-art bridge inspection technologies. This information shall be assembled from published and unpublished reports; contacts with academia, transportation agencies, industry organizations, bridge owners and contractors; and other domestic and foreign sources. Task 2. Assess the application of technologies from other fields such as offshore structures and nuclear power plants that could be used for post-tensioning and stay cable systems condition assessments. Task 3. Summarize and outline the condition assessment technologies including the advantages and disadvantages of each NDE method. Identify gaps in existing inspection technologies and propose approaches to fill these gaps. Task 4. Prepare Interim Report No. 1 that documents Tasks 1 through 3 and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project no later than 4 months after contract award. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases II and III. Phase II-- Metrics for NDE method evaluations and NDE testing procedures - Task 5. Develop metrics to evaluate NDE technologies for each condition assessment of post-tensioning and stay cable systems. Task 6. Develop testing procedures for each proposed NDE method including the design of mock-up laboratory test specimens to be used in Phase III for each condition assessment of post-tensioning and stay cable systems. The mock-up designs should replicate in-service condition and consider the scale effect, and typical tendon types and configurations on the accuracy of the results. Task 7. Prepare a detailed outline of the recommended inspection guidelines that includes each condition assessment with pertinent NDE methods, evaluation metrics, mock-up test specimens, and proposed testing procedures. Task 8. Prepare Interim Report No. 2 that documents Tasks 5 through 7 and provides an updated work plan for Phase III no later than 6 months after approval of Phase I. Phase III--Inspection guide development and final products - Task 9. Conduct the laboratory testing according to the proposed testing procedures approved in Phase II. Task 10. Prepare inspection guidelines for the various types of condition assessments of in-service post-tensioning and stay cable systems. The guidelines will be presented in a format suitable for consideration by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Subcommittees on Bridges and Structures and Maintenance. Task 11. Prepare a preliminary draft final report that documents the entire research effort. After consideration of panel comments, submit the revised final report. The Task 10 guidelines should be included as a stand-alone appendix.</abstract>

    <abstract>National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 782 presents a proposed Guideline for reliability-based bridge inspection practices and provides two case studies of the application of the proposed Guideline. The Guideline describes a methodology to develop a risk-based approach for determining the bridge inspection interval according to the requirements in the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)" legislation. The goal of the methodology is to improve the safety and reliability of bridges by focusing inspection efforts where most needed and optimizing the use of resources. The material in this report will be of immediate interest to bridge engineers.The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) mandate the frequency and methods used for the safety inspection of highway bridges. The inspection intervals specified in the NBIS require routine inspections to be conducted every 24 months, and that interval may be extended to four (4) years for bridges that meet certain criteria and are approved by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). For bridges with fracture-critical elements, hands-on inspections are required every two (2) years. The specified intervals are generally not based on performance of bridge materials or designs, but rather on experience from managing almost 600,000 bridges in the National Bridge Inventory. These inspection intervals are applied to the entire bridge inventory, but they may not be appropriate for all bridges. For example, recently constructed bridges typically experience few problems during their first decade of service and those problems are typically minor. Under the present requirements, these bridges must have the same inspection frequency and intensity as a 50-year-old bridge that is reaching the end of its service life. In the case of bridges with fracture-critical elements, newer bridges with improved fabrication processes and designs that mitigate the effects of fatigue are inspected on the same interval and to the same intensity as older bridges that do not share these characteristics. A more rational approach to determining appropriate inspection practices for bridges would consider the structure type, age, condition, importance, environment, loading, prior problems, and other characteristics of the bridge. There is a growing consensus that these inspection practices should meet two goals: (1) improving the safety and reliability of bridges and (2) optimizing resources for bridge inspection.   These goals can be accomplished through the application of reliability theory. Research was performed under NCHRP Projects 12-82 and NCHRP 12-82(01) by the University of Missouri to develop a proposed bridge inspection practice for consideration for adoption by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The methodology developed is based on rational methods to ensure bridge safety, serviceability, and effective use of resources. The report includes two parts: Part I-- Proposed Guideline for Reliability-Based Bridge Inspection Practices and Part II-- Research Report that documents the entire research effort.</abstract>

    <abstract>The aging civil infrastructure across the United States has been under the spot light due to recent bridge failures such as the I-35W bridge collapse. Many concrete and steel bridges that were built in the mid 20th century in response to the boom of automobiles are reaching their life expectancy, leaving questions about their structural integrity and deterioration levels. Millions of dollars have been invested each year to inspect bridge components using various technologies such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and seismic pavement analyzer (PSA). These equipments are normally large and carried by trucks to monitor the health of the steel reinforced concrete bridge decks. However, for some difficult to access components (e.g., bridge foundations and pillars underneath decks), it lacks effective tools for regular inspection. A common method of under bridge inspection using snooper truck by a 2-man evaluation team with handheld non-destructive evaluation (NDE) devices is proposed. Among the available NDE devices, handheld impact-echo (IE) is the most commonly used technology for evaluating concrete and masonry structures. The current practice of manual inspection has to block traffic, and is time-consuming, expensive, and exposes human workers to dangerous situations. The project proposes to develop an automatic impact-echo system on board a specially designed wall-climbing robot to automate the inspection process. Compared with manual inspection, the wall-climbing robot will be able to scan vertical surfaces of bridge foundations and horizontal surfaces at the bottom of bridge decks, reach hard-to-access places, take close-up pictures, record and send impact-echo data wirelessly to host computer, and log global positioning systems (GPS) coordinates at every test point in a software system for further analysis. A group of such wall-climbing robots can do the inspection task simultaneously, making the automated inspection faster and more thorough than manual inspection, thus saving time and money, while making the national civic infrastructure more secure.</abstract>

    <abstract>According to a comprehensive study carried out by CC Technologies in 1998, cost of corrosion to the US economy was 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 amounting to $276 billions (FHWA-RD-�01-�156). From that amount, $121 billion was spent on corrosion control, from which $107 billion was spent on protective coatings. It was reported that better corrosion protection could save up 40% of that cost. Improved practices were sited as better coating quality control and effective inspection at time of coating application, routine/periodic coating inspection during the service life of the structure, and appropriate repair action when coating degradation, delaminate or substrate corrosion is detected. In 2007, New York University Polytechnic Institute was awarded a grant by the gas industry to evaluate infrared thermography as a method for detection of early onset of corrosion in gas pipelines beneath the protective coating. Results indicated that it is possible to detect corrosion at stages earlier than it is possible to detect with current ultrasonic thickness gauges and it is possible to detect poor quality coating, such as the presence of air blisters, even in the absence of corrosion. Furthermore thermal imaging is a two dimensional technique and lends itself for inspection and documentation of surfaces. A  preliminary analysis of the application of infrared thermography as a tool for subsurface condition assessment of painted steel bridges is proposed. The objective is to detect early onset of corrosion and to detect paint delamination, both of which are not possible by visual inspection. Currently, federal guidelines hold the contractor responsible for the coating quality, however there is no practical methodology for evaluating the coating and subsurface condition.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cement manufacturing process accounts for approximately 5-7% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and has significant adverse impact on a wide range of sustainability issues including climate change, pollution and resources depletion. Increased awareness in this decade on the significance of developing sustainable and environmentally efficient infrastructure materials renewed the interest in exploring Cement Free Concrete (CFC) (also known as Alkali Activated Concrete or Geopolymer Concrete). This low energy, sustainable concretes are developed by activating fly ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag using commercially available alkali such as sodium hydroxide or sodium silicate hydrate (waterglass). However, the lack of studies and experimental data on optimum mixture proportioning of alkali activated concretes, especially for pavement application, is a serious limitation in designing and developing concretes of appropriate specifications in the field. In the proposed study, an experimental characterization to evaluate the viability of alkali activated CFC for pavement and bridge deck applications, by activating Class C fly ash or slag is recommended. The major focus of the proposed study is to identify the optimal proportion of an activator or a combination of activators that can provide adequate strength without requiring any thermal curing, making the CFCs even more energy efficient and user friendly. In addition to the optimum mixture proportion, the fresh properties (workability, setting time and heat of hydration), hardened properties (compressive, tensile, flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity and stress strain behavior), and durability performance (resistance to drying shrinkage, chloride ion penetration, alkali silica reaction) will be evaluated in comparison to the performance of a typical concrete mixture proportion that New York/New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT) use for the pavement and bridge deck construction. Intellectual Merits of the proposed study is that it will provide deeper insight into the behavior and performance of alkali activated concrete, especially for pavement and bridge deck construction applications. The experimental data obtained through this research may contribute to develop standards and guidelines that may promote the usage of this greener concrete by the DOTs, especially in Region 2.</abstract>

    <abstract>Pavements usually consist in base and sub-base layers which last 20-40 years or more, covered with a wearing coarse having a much shorter service life. The maintenance works for these surface layers induce high external costs. In order to solve the problem, intensive effort is devoted to introducing new generations of materials to enhance the performance of such surface layers. With regard to their amazing mechanical and durability performances, UHPC materials have changed to issues of great importance in this research area.  Due to time, cost, and environmental considerations, developing new concrete materials for pavement applications to achieve the minimum possible thickness is of a great significance. But, besides the mentioned benefits of producing pavement materials of minimum possible thicknesses, these materials are prone to shrinkage and cracking. As solution for this problem, the idea of fiber-reinforced mortar for the wearing surface is proposed. Pavements manufactured from ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) can provide significant durability improvement due to the high strength and extremely low permeability of the UHPC material. It is worth mentioning that to enhance both the mechanical and durability properties of these pavement materials, it is suggested to incorporate the steel and/or synthetic fibers in the mixtures as a technical and environment friendly solution. Besides it should be noted that the use of fibers can lead to a reduction in pavement depth, thus, reducing the overall costs, as well as speeding the on-site process and reducing trip hazards.</abstract>

    <abstract>Over a trillion dollars is invested in the nation's mostly aging infrastructure through various bonds and public funds. Most of that is spent on new construction and replacement of old infrastructure. It can be convincingly argued that it would be more cost effective over the long term to spend a good portion of these investments in taking a proactive course in managing the maintenance processes of the infrastructure rather than waiting and being forced to merely reacting to disruptive incidences. The importance of a proactive maintenance management policy becomes more pronounced when considering a vital transportation system such as that of highways networks and bridges. This importance emanates from the fact that an unexpected failure of a component of one of these complex systems usually creates disruptions which could have cascading effects leading not only to havoc and its consequences of inconveniences, but also to major economic effects requiring colossal expenditure to contain the damages incurred from such premature failures. Various maintenance treatments are employed by transportation agencies to slow deterioration and restore condition of pavements, bridges, culverts, signs and other physical assets. However, budget constraints and other factors have often led to delaying or eliminating the application of these treatments. Such actions are expected to adversely influence the condition and performance and lead to a reduced level of service, to early deterioration, and eventually to the need for costly rehabilitation or replacement. Analytical tools are currently available to quantify the consequences of delayed application of maintenance treatments for highway pavements, bridges, and other assets. However, processes for using these tools to demonstrate the potential savings and performance enhancement resulting from applying maintenance treatments at the right time and also optimum allocation of funds are not readily available. Hence research is needed to develop such process. This information will help highway agencies better assess the economic benefits of maintenance actions and their role in enhancing the level of service of transportation infrastructure. In addition, incorporating these processes in asset management systems would provide a means for optimizing the allocation of resources.</abstract>

    <abstract>Data required to assess the structural condition of bridge decks can be collected using various methods such as visual examination, surface sounding, removal and evaluation of samples, and noninvasive imaging. Nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques, in particular, enable rapid and comprehensive data collection. The optimal utilization of appropriate NDT technologies can result in more accurate bridge deck assessments and significantly reduced costs. The overarching goal of this pilot study is to demonstrate proof of concept that advanced nondestructive testing/evaluation (NDT/NDE) techniques can be rapidly, effectively, and economically implemented as part of the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) bridge deck surveys to improve the overall quality and cost of bridge deck evaluation. The accuracy and appropriateness of selected existing and emerging technologies will be evaluated using field data acquired from the entire suite of bridge decks investigated in this study. Technologies investigated will include two types of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and a portable seismic property analyzer (PSPA). Results of this pilot study will be used to evaluate the feasibility of a large scale, long-term program (multi-year, routine basis) that incorporates NDE techniques into MoDOT bridge deck surveys for the purpose of reducing cost on assessment and maintenance of bridge decks. The results will enable better, more cost-effective decisions of when to repair, strengthen, or replace the deteriorated bridge deck. The proposed research will also serve to educate and train multi-disciplinary students and future engineers in these technologies.</abstract>

    <abstract>The service life of concrete infrastructure elements depends on the quality of the cover-crete; outer 50 mm of the concrete. The use of high-performance concrete can indeed prolong service life of the material. However, this material is still prone to cracking.  Recently, ultra high-performance concrete (UHPC) has been introduced which has much higher mechanical properties and toughness than HPC. UHPC is typically a micro-mortar reinforced with micro fibers (typically steel fibers) resulting in extremely impermeable and crack-resistant material. Such material can be used to produce precast panels that can be assembled on-site for the construction of bridge vertical elements, such as the construction of girder and bridge pier elements. This project aims at developing UHPC that can be used as a formwork system for cast in-place bridge construction. The proposed units are targeted for bridge construction and use low carbon foot print self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and UHPC prefabricated panels reinforced with fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) bars. The use of the proposed approach can result in several advantages for the United States transportation infrastructure system, including: (1) design of fast construction and rehabilitation system for transportation infrastructure that can exhibit extended service life; (2) use of environmentally friendly SCC to cast the structural element can provide a rapid construction procedure; (3) notable savings in labor and time by designing a permanent formwork system.</abstract>

    <abstract>With ever tightening budgets, states are looking for cost-effective methods of extending the duration from initial bridge construction to complete replacement.  One common technique that serves this purpose is to replace the deck after the end of its useful service life has been reached while keeping the original superstructure and substructure.  That is, assuming that the superstructure and substructure still have adequate strength and remaining life.  For this approach to be successfully accomplished, it is critical that the deck is removed without damaging the superstructure elements.  Moreover, as the deck is often removed in large pieces, it is important to prevent concrete from falling below the bridge, especially where a roadway passes beneath.  The objective of the work is to determine the most, and/or develop new, cost-effective and efficient deck removal techniques for steel and concrete superstructure bridges.  The following criteria will be considered as part of the evaluation: Impact on the future performance of the superstructure, cost, time, safety, and noise.  Further, the work will include guidance on assessing and repairing girders that are damaged during removal of a deck.</abstract>

    <abstract>An expansion joint in a poor condition typically will not be able to resist corrosion and prevent water or chemicals from penetrating into bridge bearings and piers, which will greatly expedite the deterioration process of the bridge structure. In addition to threatening the integrity of bridge structures, a damaged expansion joint may also cause serious risks of traffic accidents when vehicles pass in high speeds. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), over 60% of the joints were leaking water and 40% were experiencing problems that would shorten their service lives. According to the existing studies, the actual damage scenarios of expansion joints for a particular bridge can be pretty complicated. One critical challenge lies on the failure of rationally considering the interactions of bridge joints and vehicles, especially considering the deteriorating process of the joints. For example, traffic loads induce more dynamic impacts on the joints which cause damages. More damages, such as unevenness will cause more dynamic interactions with passing vehicles, which in turn cause more impacts loads on the joints from the vehicles. Such a process continues which will accelerate the deterioration process of the joints. As an important step toward tackling the accelerating damage problem of expansion joints, the objective of this study would be to characterize the basic interactions between the passing traffic and the deteriorating joints by developing a rational model. As a result, better understanding of the lifetime performance of the joints can be achieved.</abstract>

    <abstract>The degradation of civil infrastructure is an ongoing problem in terms of not only structural engineering but in maintenance planning as well. The major dilemma for bridge owners is detecting the degradation of the structure, and effective planning with regards to maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or replacement. This difficulty increases when the structure becomes difficult to inspect due to access restrictions or discontinuities that cannot be seen visually. Despite these challenges, it has been shown that nondestructive tests and monitoring can help assess the condition of the bridge so that informed decisions regarding maintenance can be made. The rising demand for ensuring the integrity and performance of our nation's bridges that are usually subjected to severe environmental effects require inspection for evaluation of their structural conditions. A combination of load and corrosion loss is the main cause of deterioration in both concrete and steel bridges. For concrete bridges in long-term service, the degradation caused by corrosion of reinforcement due to chloride ingress and concrete cracking is the major problem. The rate of deterioration is unpredictable in both materials. Thus, the danger to motorists and the economic consequences that the failure of a bridge would create is self evident. Improvement in safety of the nation's transportation network is The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT's) stated priority. Highways are vital components of the transportation infrastructure. Thus safety of highway bridges is crucial for improving the safety of the nation's transportation network. In a technologically advanced nation like ours, it is imperative to conduct research and utilize technologies that enhance highway bridge safety for achievement of such goals. Research on and utilization of non-destructive test and monitoring technologies is one of the focus areas in ESITAC's strategic planning. It is thus proposed to utilize non-destructive testing technology (NDT), in collaboration with VDOT's District Structure and Bridge Engineering Department and its research arm the Virginia Center of Transportation Innovation and Research (VCTIR), for accurate, reliable and durable methods to investigate degradation mechanisms of highway bridges and to help take remedial measures to prevent spread of degradation.  There are concrete beam and steel girder bridges in the state of Virginia. There is an inherent need and interest by researchers to have a better understanding regarding the failure process for this type of bridge, and subsequently, the desire to improve and enhance the ability to inspect these types of bridge structures. Thus the purpose of this proposal is to illustrate how the use of acoustic emission (AE) monitoring can provide real-time information regarding the structural integrity of the girders and pillars on the bridge while in use. Previous AE studies on bridges such as the one on Coastguard Blvd. in Portsmouth, VA and the ongoing investigations on the bridge at Denbigh Boulevard have provided a comfortable basis on the utility of AE technology for real time investigations without the affecting the traffic flow. In the proposed studies, this project focuses specifically on corrosion aspects of the degradation even as we continue to establish the role of freight traffic movement under a bridge on bridge structural components. Accordingly, for the period of 2012 - 2013, a potential test bridge like Virginia Structure No. 2222, Federal Structure ID 20727 in Newport News, Virginia will be studied in consultations and discussions with Virginia Council for Transportation Innovation and Research (VCTIR) and VDOT's District Structure and Bridge Engineering Department.</abstract>

    <abstract>The goal of this research program in Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is to improve the safety and reliability of bridges.  The results of this research will enhance the safety of the transportation infrastructure by providing better tools for the safety condition assessment of bridges during fabrication, inspection and repair.  The research will also enhance the state of good repair by developing technologies for detecting deterioration in its embryonic stages, when maintenance and preservation strategies can be implemented to ensure the state of good repair.  The benefit is better, safer and longer lasting steel and concrete bridges and related structures. Three promising areas will be the focus of this research:   1)	Vehicle-mounted Infrared Thermography for Bridge Condition Assessment Develop a flexible, portable platform for infrared thermography that enables the technology to be vehicle-mounted for scanning bridge decks, bridge soffits and tunnels at close to normal traffic speeds.   2) Develop Phase Array Ultrasonic Testing for Steel Fabrication Improve the quality control process for steel fabrication to improve the reliability, safety and quality of welded constructions. 3) Ultrasonic Measurement of In-Situ Stress Levels in Gusset Plates  Measure the actual the actual in-situ stress levels in the gusset plates to ensure structural safety.  This experimental research will explore that application of these technologies for practical applications for bridge condition assessment.  The research will also make a strong contribution to the education and training of students in the important arena of inspection and condition assessment of the civil infrastructure, where current curriculum is lacking.  These technologies can make significant improvements in the ability of engineers and inspectors to assess the condition of bridges to improve highway safety and ensure the state of good repair.</abstract>

    <abstract>In 2008, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Subcommittee for Bridges and Structures approved a resolution for a tunnel definition:  "Tunnels are defined as enclosed roadways with vehicle access that is restricted to portals regardless of type of structure or method of construction. Tunnels do not include highway bridges, railroad bridges or other bridges over a roadway. Tunnels are structures that require special design considerations that may include lighting, ventilation, fire protection systems, and emergency egress capacity based on the owners determination." Every year, significant public funds are needed to inspect and maintain tunnels that were not designed to be easily inspected and maintained. Nevertheless, well planned preventive maintenance is a cost-effective strategy to keep tunnels safe and operational. Tunnel preservation includes actions or strategies that prevent, delay, or reduce deterioration of tunnel systems (preventive maintenance), restore the function of existing tunnels (repair or rehabilitation), and keep tunnels in good condition and extend their useful life. Often practitioners apply preservation strategies on the basis of judgment or common sense using available resources. However, it is difficult to translate these strategies into coherent and convincing arguments that will lead to support for aggressive and well planned programs of highway tunnel preservation. These programs may be inadequately funded due to absence of a creditable, quantitative basis for measuring effectiveness. The objective of this research is to develop a guide for possible adoption by AASHTO that will (1) assemble a catalog of highway tunnel preservation actions; (2) quantify the benefits of tunnel preservation actions; (3) provide decision-making tools to optimize tunnel preservation actions; and (4) develop a method to determine appropriate levels of funding and staffing to achieve agency selected goals and performance measures. The guide shall cover tunnel systems that consist of the tunnel and its applicable structures, drainage systems, mechanical systems, electrical systems, lighting, security, signs, incident detection systems, overhead vehicle detection systems, traffic management systems, information management systems, and miscellaneous appurtenances within the tunnel.  The guide will be applicable to the preservation of existing tunnels and to preservation planning during the design of new tunnels, in urban and rural areas. Accomplishment of the project objective will require at least the following phases: PHASE I--Preservation Actions That Impact Highway Tunnel Systems - Deliverables in this phase shall include the following: (1) A critical review of existing technical literature, pertinent international and domestic scans, and NCHRP research projects. In addition, the review should include owner and industry practices related to tunnel operation and maintenance for at least two major tunnels in the states; the FHWA Tunnel Operations, Maintenance, Inspection and Evaluation (TOMIE) Manual (Chapter 3--Maintenance); and other research findings from both foreign and domestic sources. (2) A catalog of highway tunnel systems preservation actions. (3) Metrics that can be used to analyze the effectiveness of preservation actions considering when and which action to apply and the impacts of applying or delaying an action. (4) A proposed method, for further analysis in Phase II, to prioritize preservation actions according to the identified metrics. (5) A proposed method to determine appropriate levels of funding and staffing to achieve agency selected goals and performance measures. (6) A detailed outline for the guide. The guide shall be developed for direct use with the flexibility to be customized by highway tunnel owners. (7) Interim Report No. 1 that documents deliverables 1 through 6 of Phase I and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project no later than 6 months after contract award. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases II through IV. PHASE II-- Development of the Proposed Methods - Deliverables in this phase shall include the following: (1) A detailed method with examples to prioritize preservation actions according to the identified metrics in Phase I. Proposals shall describe the number of examples to be provided. The examples shall consider different highway tunnels in urban and rural areas.  The method shall be implemented into decision-making processes. (2) A detailed method with examples to determine appropriate levels of funding and staffing to achieve agency selected goals and performance measures. The research team shall consider consequences of different investment scenarios. (3) An annotated description of each section and subsection of the proposed guide along with the expected level of detail of each subsection. (4) A complete sample section of the guide that is publication ready with appropriate level of detail. (5) Interim Report No. 2 that documents deliverables 1 through 4 of Phase II and provides an updated work plan for the remainder of the project no later than 10 months after Phase I approval. The updated plan must describe the process and rationale for the work proposed for Phases III through IV. PHASE III--Draft Guide for Preservation of Highway Tunnel Systems - The deliverable for this phase will be the draft guide to be submitted no later than 10 months after Phase II approval and 6 months before the contract end date. PHASE IV--Final Products - Deliverables in this phase shall include the following: (1) Revised guide for preservation of highway tunnel systems after consideration of panel's review comments. (2) A final report that documents the entire research effort including an implementation plan.</abstract>

    <abstract>The useful service life of a bridge deck and girder is a function of a number of several variables: load magnitudes, number of load cycles, and decision as to when it should be renewed (by overlay or replacement). Many of the details used in older steel bridge girders are particularly prone to fatigue failures directly related to truck weight. Repetitive loading may cause fatigue cracking in these steel members and limit the service life of a bridge. Truck-weight frequency distributions by vehicle type (i.e., truck weight histograms) are needed to estimate the effects on remaining life and the costs caused by changes in legal and permit truck weights. Changing truck weights can affect the truck weight histograms. Because carrying higher payloads can reduce the operating costs of truck operators, the possibility of a growing share of freight (e.g., shifting from rail to truck) will be considered in estimating the future truck weight distribution and truck traffic.  The first objective of the research is to quantify the effect of meeting increasing freight demands with heavier trucks to reduce the growth in the number of trucks on the road. Specifically, the effect of heavier trucks on bridge infrastructure will be quantified with regard (to) the force effects experienced by the bridges and the effects on the durability and longevity of bridges. The second objective is to compare the effect of heavier trucks with the doubling in the number of heavy vehicles under the present legal weight restrictions. The primary goal of both tasks is to determine if allowing an increase in truck weight provides better or worse bridge durability and longevity when compared to increasing the number of trucks to meet freight demands. Finally, specific configurations of heavy trucks, such as additional axles or long-combinations, will also be investigated to minimize the effect of a weight increase and reduce the impact to bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>This project focuses on the development of methodologies for obtaining reliable Finite Element (FE) models of bridges from measurements of their structural response to ambient as well as earthquake and wind excitations. Comparing such models from different times, for example before and after an earthquake or before and after a maintenance/rehabilitation operation, can provide information on the presence of structural damage and/or on the effectiveness of a rehabilitation solution. These methodologies will be compared with other types of damage detection methodologies that do not require an initial FE model of the structure: these methods try to "recognize a pattern" in the response of the structure corresponding to its healthy state (hence the name of "pattern recognition"). By looking at how this pattern changes, the project proposes developing a methodology that can assess the presence (amount as well as location) of structural damage.</abstract>

    <abstract>Precast concrete bridge deck panels and precast concrete deck-bulb-tee girders both present solutions capable of facilitating accelerated construction/reconstruction/rehabilitation of highway bridges. However, the connections between these elements, which must be completed in the field, have proved to be a hurdle to successful implementation. In short, the connections between elements present long-term durability concerns and often result in less than desirable performance of the system as a whole. Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) is a type of advanced cementitious material that is particularly well suited to highway bridge applications due to its enhanced durability and increased strengths as compared to conventional concretes. UHPC has the potential to work particularly well in connection details between precast elements due to its ability to develop mild steel reinforcement over short distances allowing for the design of minimal width cast-in-place joints which do not require post-tensioning or complex embedments. New York State DOT (NYSDOT) is particularly interested in this concept and is completing two bridge rehabilitation projects during the summer of 2009 which implement the cast-in-place UHPC connection. NYSDOT has partnered with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to investigate the performance of the cast-in-place UHPC connection detail through full-scale structural testing at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center. The objective of this study is to investigate the structural performance of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) connection details developed for implementation in precast concrete bridge deck systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>The AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications prescribe the use of a design vehicular live load, designated as HL-93, consisting of a combination of a "design truck" plus a "design lane" or "design tandem" plus a "design lane" whichever creates the worst effect.  These are not intended to represent any specific truck loading, or specific loading condition, but rather to provide a level of structural demand (in terms of bending moments, shears, deflections, etc.) such that it envelopes most vehicle loads that the bridge will be required to carry during its service life.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to validate the use of the AASHTO HL-93 design vehicular live load for bridge design and rating in Vermont. The research methodology involves collecting/transferring/classifying data from WIM stations, statistical analysis of WIM truck data, high performance computing for stochastic structural analysis simulations and computation of the probability of exceedance of structural demands with respect to the LRFD HL-93 vehicular loading. At the end of the project, we will have a quantifiable estimate of the resulting structural reliability of bridges in Vermont if the HL-93 design load is adopted.</abstract>

    <abstract>Many bridges on the local highway system need replacement. Local governments rely on the South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) to help replace the deficient bridges. With limited resources, SDDOT can only help replace about 30 bridges statewide each year, causing a backlog of local bridges in need of replacement. The current standard bridge used in these replacements is the double tee precast girder bridge for its relatively low construction cost, outsourced design, and short construction duration. The expected design life of these bridges was 50 to 70 years, but some built less than 40 years ago already need replacement. The most common problem is that longitudinal joints become damaged over time, most likely due to inadequate shear transfer between the girders, allowing water and debris to enter the joints. It is only a matter of time before the joint begins to spall, creating a path for moisture to reach the prestressing steel, initiate corrosion, and degrade the structural capacity of the bridge. It should also be noted that the double tee should be designed for girder continuity, often achieved by a reinforced concrete overlay or transverse posttensioning. Many local bridges are not designed for girder continuity, however, resulting in longitudinal joint deterioration and a non-redundant structure.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study will evaluate the seismic performance of concrete filled steel tube (CFST) bridge columns for potential use in emergency or accelerated bridge construction (ABC) projects. The main goal of the study is to determine whether CFST columns can be designed to perform adequately under gravitational loads and seismic hazard before the concrete reaches its design strength. The project will need to investigate the effect of reduced seismic loading for this temporary condition on the CSFT limit states of interest, such as serviceability and ultimate limit state. Columns used for ABC are usually precast components that can be rapidly installed on-site. One of the main challenges with these columns is to keep their weight within a practical weight range for transporting and handling. Special care is also needed when designing splices to connect the foundation to precast piers in high seismic hazard zones. The use of CFST columns largely reduces these problems because the steel tubes are erected prior to pouring the concrete, and can be easily connected to the foundation. Composite columns may be advantageous for ABC because the steel components can be designed to withstand the gravitational deck loads and a reduced seismic hazard. The total seismic capacity of the component is obtained once the filled concrete reaches the design concrete strength. Thus, the bridge performance needs to be analyzed under a seismic hazard for temporary conditions. Several studies have assessed the possibility of reducing seismic hazard for shorter system exposure times. For instance, Amin et al. (1999) developed a methodology for computing reduced seismic loads for nuclear power plant components subjected to temporary conditions. Olson et al. (1994) developed a quantitative procedure for using available site-specific annual seismic hazard curves to determine an acceleration level for evaluating temporary conditions. Application of this procedure for a sample site resulted in seismic accelerations for compliance periods of one month that were about 33% of the design basis. Boggs and Peterka (1992) developed a procedure for specifying the design recurrence interval for a temporary structure such that the probability of failure is the same than that of permanent structures. However, Hill (2004) considered that temporal structures should have the same ability to sustain loads than permanent systems, independently of the exposure time. Cornell and Bandyopadhyay (1996) identified several challenges when applying reduced seismic loads that will be considered in this study, such as the definition of temporal loads, and license renewal of systems exposed to temporal loading. Regarding the performance of CFST columns, Marson and Bruneau (2004) tested composite columns under axial and lateral loads. The diameters of these columns were 324 and 406 mm, with a D/t ratio ranging from 34 to 64. The columns reached drifts of 7% before a significant loss in moment capacity. Strength deterioration after the maximum strength was reached was slow until fracture occurred during cycling at 7% drift. They indicated that CFST columns provide an effective mechanism to dissipate seismic energy, and can be effective for bridge columns in seismic regions, although they indicated that further research is needed for larger components. Han et al. (2011) also concluded that circular CSFT columns have excellent seismic resistance and confirmed that the lateral load-carrying capacity and ductility decreased as the axial load level in the column increased. Recent studies have performed limited tests to evaluate the effect of concrete strength on the ultimate capacity of CSFT columns. For instance, An et al. (2012) showed that the capacity of CFST columns can be more than twice that of hollow tubes. As expected, the tube's capacity increases as the concrete strength increases, and the concrete strength contribution to CSFT capacity is less significant for columns of large slenderness ratio.</abstract>

    <abstract>Although still in their infancy, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bridges have shown great promise in eliminating corrosion concerns and meeting (or exceeding) the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA's) goal of 100-year life spans for bridges. While FRP bridges are cost-effective in terms of life cycle analyses, the combination of higher first costs and limited state DOT budgets has restricted their use. One area that has shown some headway is the use of FRP for bridge decks, focusing on the location where the majority of corrosion-related damage normally occurs. However, first costs still hamper widespread use of this approach. FRP bridge deck panels offer superior corrosion resistance, at one-fifth the weight of reinforced concrete. However, current FRP bridge deck panels typically rely on an intricate geometric honeycomb system between the top and bottom layers of the sandwich panel. This labor-intensive honeycomb construction doubles the cost of FRP panels compared to reinforced concrete. Although cost-effective in terms of longevity of the bridge and overall reductions in weight, the lower first cost of reinforced concrete precludes the use of FRP bridge decks in the majority of situations. Closed-cell, high-density polyurethane foams lower first cost, offering a cost-effective alternative to the complex honeycomb construction. Structural sandwich panels with a polyurethane foam infill are well established in other commercial applications, such as automobiles, aircraft, and prefabricated buildings. Several recent advances in polyurethane foam formulations have resulted in a material that can resist the localized compressive stresses and fatigue loading beneath a truck wheel, making this type of sandwich panel construction a viable alternative for bridge decks. Once these panels can compete against reinforced concrete on a first-cost basis, their significantly longer life expectancies will save considerable money for the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and the residents of Missouri. The first step in establishing FRP sandwich panels as a viable option will be to examine the potential of using them to replace the precast, stay-in-place forms currently used to construct reinforced concrete bridge decks. The sandwich panel will serve as formwork for the concrete placement and act compositely with the hardened concrete under subsequent dead and live loading. As part of the sandwich panel development, Missouri University of Science and Technology will evaluate polyurethane foam formulations, panel configurations (overall shape, jointing, end bearing), panel fiber architecture, panel durability, and methods of developing composite action with the concrete.</abstract>

    <abstract>Prestressed beams have been a popular beam of choice for building highway bridges in the Midwest since the early 1960s. Although these beam types are economical and are proven to carry traffic loads well, they are starting to show signs of distress, mostly from corrosion of the steel reinforcement that is caused by moisture contaminated with salt and chlorides. Salt used for deicing roadways causes chlorides to penetrate the beams and cause the steel reinforcement and prestressing strands to corrode. Some states use pre-stressed box beams because of their efficient cross section and small beam depth to span ratio. Today, many of these structures are reaching the end of their service life, mainly because of corrosion of the steel reinforcement. In the harsh environment of the Midwest, where bridges are exposed to many freeze thaw cycles and deicing salts it would be beneficial to have a bridge structure free from corrosion, easy to inspect, and a service life at least double that of current structures. Also, since mobility of the traveling public is a very important consideration when building or rehabilitating bridges, there is a need to develop a beam type that can be built using accelerated bridge construction techniques. The objective of this project is to analyze and evaluate the decked bulb T beam (or decked I beam) as a viable replacement for the side-by-side box-beam bridge. The project description uses the term bulb T beam as a general description of an I beam shape, with a wide top flange that can serve as a deck surface. For this type of beam to be a viable replacement to a box beam, it must have a very robust cross-section designed to have a shallow depth to span ratio, which makes it very different than the standard American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) section used by some states. The use of a bulb T beam cross section would eliminate inherent problems associated with the ability to inspect and repair box-beam type structures. The Bulb T beam cross-section will provide enough space at the section bottom for ease of periodical inspections and maintenance of critical elements, such as beam web and the suffit of the bridge deck slab.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of the research project is to develop a durable repair system for deteriorated steel bridge piles that can be implemented without the need for dewatering. A rigorous survey of the relevant practice nationwide will be conducted to inform and direct the remaining research efforts. The current state-of-practice will be critically reviewed and the most promising alternatives will be identified for detailed investigation. The structural performance, constructability, and economy of the existing systems will be considered. A simplified but reliable framework for assessing the condition of deteriorated piles will be developed. The framework will be used to direct the full-scale testing of artificially deteriorated and repaired piles. Accelerated environmental exposure tests will also be conducted to evaluate the durability of the different repair systems. The results of the full-scale tests and the environmental durability tests will be used to direct a life-cycle cost analysis to identify the most economical repair systems based on initial costs, life-cycle costs, agency costs, and user costs. To evaluate the performance of the repair systems in ' real ' applications, field testing and long-term monitoring will be conducted at two bridge sites. Based on the research findings, guidelines for the design, construction, and maintenance of the systems will be developed to facilitate transfer of the technology to TxDOT bridge maintenance operations. The successful completion of the research project is expected to lead to the development of a new method and guidelines for repair of steel bridge piles which will significantly enhance the safety and economy of existing bridge infrastructure throughout the state.</abstract>

    <abstract>Hydrodemolition of bridge decks has proven to be an economical and efficient way to remove deteriorated concrete so as to facilitate the installation of a new concrete surface thereby prolonging the life of the bridge. One of the remaining difficulties with hydrodemolition is how to deal with the large quantities of runoff (HRW) or wastewater generated during the process. This project will investigate the possibilities of using the wastewater in the concrete recycling industry and applying it to land in North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) right-of-ways. Potential use in the concrete recycling industry will be assessed by characterizing the HRW and interviewing industry personnel. Land application in NCDOT right-of-ways will be assessed by a combination of small scale greenhouse studies and field site evaluations including soil, vegetation, and topography measurements. These data will then be used to develop a protocol for NCDOT to determine when and how much HRW can be safely applied to a section of highway right-of-way.</abstract>

    <abstract>According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, as of December 2008, of the 600,905 bridges 72,868 (12.1%) were categorized as structurally deficient (SD) and 89,024 (14.8%) were categorized as functionally obsolete (FO). Despite�a healthy economy during the period 1999- 2005, the numbers of SD and FO bridges were on the rise. It is very clear that bridge evaluation and maintenance policies are not working efficiently. The high numbers of SD and FO bridges should not be allowed to continue to rise. Given the current state of the US economy, smarter bridge management policies should be adopted, as we cannot afford the high cost of proper maintenance of our huge transportation civil infrastructure. Regardless of age and condition, current practice requires bi-annual inspection of highway bridges, which results in costly inspection caused by unnecessary frequent inspections of newer bridges and lack of frequent inspection of older bridges. There is a need for a more rational approach for setting bridge inspection frequency based on safety, condition, design, age of the structure, and engineering judgment. In addition, there should be a clearer differentiation between maintenance and repair. The cost of major repairs is much higher than timely preventive maintenance measures. There are many cases where minor maintenance activity is delayed until it becomes a structural deficiency, which resulted in high number of bridges categorized as structurally deficient. Practical experience coupled with non-destructive test (NDT) data produce good assessment of bridge condition. The question is how to utilize NDT data to develop a cost-effective maintenance policy for bridges. NDT data should not only be used for assessing current condition of bridges, but also to predict its deterioration rate and its future maintenance needs. NDT data of the likelihood of corrosion in a bridge component is a very good indication of its future deterioration rate in the following few years. If implemented, low cost maintenance measures would stop or slow the deterioration rate resulting in lower maintenance cost over the service life of the bridge. This paper will present smart use of NDT data to predict the near future service life of concrete bridge components, and its utilization for cost-effective maintenance policy, in a limited financial resources environment. The impact of this study will enhance the following: (1) development of a better rational for setting maintenance frequency based on condition, (2) development of low-cost maintenance measures for better control of deterioration rate, (3) understanding of financial consequences of delayed maintenance, and (4) reduction of the number of structurally deficient bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of the proposed research is to improve the safety of bridge structures in the state of Alaska through implementation of innovative structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies to evaluate the structural integrity and serviceability, and to provide reliable information for changing structural response, decision-making of maintenance/repair and closure, etc. of monitored bridges. Based on a synthesis of current-in-use and emerging SHM knowledge and technologies with a specific interest in what could be potentially used on bridges in cold, remote regions, such as Alaska, this research is to establish a bridge SHM program for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (AK DOT&amp;amp;PF). This objective is going to be achieved by identifying appropriate technologies, developing technologies where items are needed but missing, and implementing these technologies to remotely monitor and on-site evaluate the structurally deficient Chulitna River Bridge. A SHM protocol will be developed for applications to bridges in the State of Alaska. A SHM system with a variety of sensors will be developed to measure and monitor structural and environmental conditions to assist in evaluation of the Chulitna River Bridge performance. This system will be designed to detect bridge structural defects or deterioration in its early stages and to assist in the prediction of its future performance. It will also be utilized to mitigate impacts resulting from changed conditions. It is expected that this system will be able to provide more reliable information on the real structural health condition. We expect that it can be used to improve safe performance of this bridge. As a new safety and management tool, monitoring will complement traditional bridge inspection methods. Implementation of an effective monitoring system will likely result in a reduction in inspection manpower, early detection of deterioration/damage, development of optimum inspection and repair schedules before the deterioration/damage grows to a condition where major repairs are required and as a result this technology can used to reduce life cycle costs.</abstract>

    <abstract>It has now been well-documented that mast-arm type structural supports for traffic signals can exhibit large-amplitude vibrations under wind excitation. Such vibrations can result in reduced fatigue life of the arm to pole shaft connection, and are believed to be the cause of many failures of traffic signal structures that have been reported in the state of Texas as well as in other states within the US. Extensive research has been conducted to study the causes of the vibrations and to develop corresponding mitigation strategies. To this date, however, the excitation mechanisms and the vibration characteristics are yet to be fully understood, and countermeasures that are both effective and efficient remain to be successfully developed. The objectives of this research project are: (1) to further understand the mechanisms of traffic signal structure vibrations and to develop analytical models that enable statistically assessing the failure risk of Texas standard traffic signal structures; (2) to develop guidelines for the design, fabrication, and implementation of traffic signal structures , such as limitations on placement and sizes of items placed on signal pole arms; and 3) to develop mitigation strategies for reducing or eliminating wind induced vibrations. We will conduct four phases of study to achieve the prescribed objectives. In phase I, we will conduct full-scale field measurements of representative traffic signal structures and wind tunnel tests of sectional models to further understand the excitation mechanisms and the vibration characteristics. In phase II, we will develop analytical models based on understandings from phase I for predicting wind-induced vibration characteristics and estimating fatigue loads of traffic signal structures of various configurations. In phase III, we will develop statistical methodologies for assessment of failure risk by integrating structure-specific vibration characteristics and fatigue capacity with site-specific wind climate data. In phase IV, we will use the combination of analytical simulation and full-scale measurements to develop guidelines for design, fabrication, and implementation of traffic signal structures, as well as to develop, test, and optimize mitigation devices for reducing or eliminating wind-induced vibrations of support structures for traffic signals.</abstract>

    <abstract>An increasing number of state transportation agencies have developed highway structure inventories of mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls. The long-term performance of these walls depends on various factors. This project will study these data to learn how states predict, measure, and track the performance of MSE walls. The results of this study may lead to better design, construction, monitoring, and maintenance of these important structures.</abstract>

    <abstract>State and local governments must address the ongoing need for replacement of bridges and box culverts. Especially on local road systems, a significant portion of structures have far exceeded their expected lives and have become structurally or functionally obsolete.

In many situations, cast-in-place and precast concrete structures are sound, economical replacement alternatives involving some tradeoffs. Cast-in-place structures generally offer excellent performance, but may require longer construction duration and more complex on-site effort. In contrast, precast structures can offer simpler and quicker on-site construction, but occasional problems with performance have been reported. While the relative initial economy of cast-in-place and precast construction methods can be determined from construction bid prices, long-term or life-cycle costs (which depend upon performance) are not well established. Furthermore, it is possible that the selection of the most cost-effective construction method depends upon specific site conditions or design requirements. For example, one type may more effectively address short span lengths, box culvert cross-sections, or stream flows.

To enable local and state transportation agencies to invest their limited funding most effectively, research is needed to provide guidance regarding selection of the most cost-effective concrete bridge construction designs and methods suitable for South Dakota</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge deck deterioration is one of the most extensive problems for bridge maintenance. Using waterproofing membrane might be a good way to mitigate this problem. A recent International Scan,"Assuring Bridge Safety and Serviceability," in Europe found agencies consistently reported success with the incorporation of waterproofing membranes for new concrete bridge deck construction as a means of both extending service life and circumventing the need to rehabilitate or replace bridge decks. In contrast, their usage in the United States remains, to a large extent, limited. This study will update to NCHRP Synthesis 220 Waterproofing Membranes for Concrete Bridge Decks (1995). It will assemble, organize, evaluate and document information related to advances in materials, design, construction and performance of waterproofing membranes for existing and new bridge decks. In particular, the identification of domestic materials, processes and installation practices which have been successful, as well as why domestic systems have failed, is needed.</abstract>

    <abstract>NCHRP Project 22-23, "Criteria for the Restoration of Damaged Guardrails," has effectively been completed by researchers at Virginia Tech. As part of this project, researchers surveyed the states to determine what, if any, formal guidelines they have for the maintenance of guardrails. The study determined that while some states did have guidelines for evaluating existing guardrails and determining whether maintenance was indicated, these guidelines were typically based on judgment and were not supported by underlying research. The objective of Project 22-23 was to develop guidelines to assist maintenance personnel in identifying levels of damage and deterioration to longitudinal barriers that require repairs to restore operational performance. To achieve this objective, the researchers evaluated for eleven damage and deterioration modes commonly associated with the standard strong steel post W-beam (modified G41S) guardrail; they evaluated these modes through a combination of component testing, pendulum testing, finite element simulation, and full-scale crash testing. From this testing, draft maintenance guidelines were developed. Final guidelines for the maintenance of longitudinal barriers will be presented in a final report, due to be completed in May 2010. It is anticipated that maintenance guidelines for cable barriers will be developed under NCHRP Project 22-25. The objective of this problem statement is to continue the work begun under NCHRP Project 22-23. While this initial project did groundbreaking work in evaluating the performance of barriers having damaged components, there were limitations to the work that could be undertaken in one study. Among the additional research needs are: (1) Evaluation of wood post systems - The 22-23 final report will include maintenance guidelines for strong-wood-post W-beam systems. However, as the testing done under 22-23 was limited to steel-post systems, there is a need to conduct similar testing and evaluation of wood posts and wood post guardrail systems to confirm that these guidelines are applicable to wood-post systems as well. (2) Overlapping damage modes - The evaluations under NCHRP 22-23 were limited to one damage mode at a time. Oftentimes, though, more than one mode of damage will be present in a given barrier. An example would be rail flattening in combination with rail deflection. There is a need to better understand the interaction between overlapping damage modes and how these would affect barrier performance. (3) Generic End Treatments - Maintenance guidelines for generic end treatments were presented in 22-23, but these were largely drawn from guidelines developed by state departments of transportation (DOTs). Similar to the issue with wood posts, these guidelines should be quantitatively tested and evaluated. (4) Damage to barriers near end terminals - A previously damaged rail element within the first 50 feet of rail in an energy-absorbing terminal may not properly activate the end terminal in a head-on crash. If these rail units are not straight, the rail element may lose column strength and be unable to resist buckling when impacted end-on. (5) Consideration of damage modes to other similar systems such as the recently developed Midwest Guardrail System, a generic W-beam guardrail system with a 31-inch mounting height. (6) It is anticipated that the research program will involve a combination of component testing, pendulum testing, and computer simulation of crash tests. Full-scale crash testing may be considered if necessary to validate the other methods of analysis, but will not be the focus of research. The following efforts are considered important to the successful completion of this research: (1) Review the experience of field maintenance staff using maintenance guidelines developed in NCHRP Project 22-23. (2) Identify damage assessment needs which will include the needs identified in the NCHRP 22-23 final report and any additional assessment needs chosen in consultation with the project panel. (3) Propose a research program to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the needs identified earlier in this problem statement. (4) Prepare an interim report that outlines the findings of the above efforts for review and comment by the project panel. (5) Upon panel approval, conduct planned analyses and supporting tests to develop the metrics for assessing longitudinal barrier damage, correlating them to safety performance. (6) Prepare a plan of full-scale crash testing necessary to fully validate the guidelines developed under this project. (7) Prepare a final report to document the research effort and recommended guidelines. Maintenance personnel are charged with making decisions as to when damaged guardrails needed to be repaired. Prior to NCHRP 22-23, only limited guidance was available to guide such decisions, and there was no supporting research available on which to make such judgments. NCHRP 22-23 has addressed this need, in part, but additional work remains to be done. This project will result in additional guidelines directed at garage-level maintenance employees who make the day-to-day decisions regarding the need to repair guardrail systems. The payoff of improved decisions by these staff will be the ability to focus their maintenance efforts on those barrier installations that truly need repair to maintain their performance under vehicular impacts.&lt;p&gt;�&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>Rockfall protection systems have been in service along roadways in Europe and the United States for more than 40 years. Rockfall protection systems utilizing steel netting to control the rockfall include ring-net barrier fences, cable-net barrier fences, draped cable-net, draped wire-mesh, and attenuators. Many of the systems are proprietary. These systems are intended to control rockfall and/or reduce the potential for rock debris to fall within highway alignments. The protection systems include components such as wire rings, wire rope, wire rope nets, wire mesh, posts, pins, fasteners, and breaking elements. These components are usually designed and rated based on testing in terms of energy capacity or energy reduction of a single rockfall event with some consideration for serviceability after specific impacts. However, the long-term performance and maintenance issues of these systems are a growing concern since many departments of transportation that have installed these systems are faced with significant maintenance, repair and/or replacement costs once a rockfall event occurs. The objective of the research is to provide owners and manufactures of rockfall systems with guidelines to evaluate vulnerability and maintenance issues associated with rockfall protection systems that use steel netting. The report will also provide estimates for design life expectancies of various systems. The design guidelines should also include a method to determine when to replace and upgrade these types of rockfall protection systems. Initiation of this work is urgent. The payoff from this research includes a safer highway system, improved prioritization of funds, reduced maintenance and clean-up costs, and reduced life-cycle costs associated with design, construction, and maintenance of rockfall hazard protection systems. Results of the research will be useful to transportation agencies charged with managing rockfall hazards. In the United States, thousands of rockfalls occur annually along highways; consequently, rockfall protection systems have become an important component of highway safety. Often these protection systems are placed along scenic sections of highways carrying large volumes of traffic, particularly during tourist season and for seasonal recreation destinations. Products from this research, which include a recommended practice for inspection and review of the service life, are needed for better selection of materials and components incorporated into rockfall protection systems. Currently, there are no well-defined provisions or protocols for condition assessment and service life modeling of rockfall protection systems. The recommended practice developed as part of this research would be in a format consistent with AASHTO requirements.&lt;p&gt;�&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>There is limited experience in the state departments of transportation (DOTs) with new tunnel design. Most agencies rely on consultants who specialize in tunnel work for design and construction assistance. In addition, The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has established a goal to have federally funded projects for "structures other than bridges," like tunnels design by load rating factor design (LRFD), by October 1, 2010. The objective of this proposal is to develop specifications, commentary, and guidelines for tunnel design. The proposal focuses on design standards for structural design, geotechnical design, ventilation, fire control and suppression, and public signing. Very little design guidance is provided in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications for Tunnels in Section 12, Buried Structures and Tunnel Liners. The material on tunnels will be removed and included in a new section. Additional specifications and guidance must be developed and included in the new section. It is expected that the contractor will use existing guidelines, especially those developed by FHWA and the National Fire Prevention Association, to prepare the specifications, commentary, and guidelines. This strategic research need is identified in the AASHTO Highway Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures' 2005 Strategic Plan for Bridge Engineering, as part of Grand Challenge 4, Advancing the AASHTO Specifications, Grand Challenge 1, Extending Service Life, and Grand Challenge 2, Optimizing Structural Systems. The objective of the proposed research is to improve the design of highway tunnels by developing specifications and guidelines for road tunnel design. The research will produce a draft design specification and commentary in the format of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. There is an urgent need to develop and improve the current methods of tunnel design, operation, and rehabilitation. These improved methodologies will increase the reliability and effectiveness of highway tunnel operations, leading to improved tunnel safety and more effective operation and management of tunnels in state and local tunnel inventories. The results of this research will provide guidelines suitable for implementation by state DOTs. It is anticipated that the research results will be presented to the AASHTO Subcommittee on Bridges and Structures, T-20 Technical Committee on Tunnels, for consideration and adoption into the LRFD Specifications. The technical committee will work with FHWA and NHI to develop training as needed based on the new specifications.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridge preservation is a systematic proactive effort to significantly extend the service life of a bridge or bridge elements, usually at the least possible cost. Many transportation departments may have a significant amount of largely empirical data on experiences with bridge preservation and have developed conclusions on the effectiveness of bridge preservation based on those experiences. However, few systematic studies have been done to measure, evaluate, and document the short- and long-term results and effects of bridge preservation actions. No attempts have been made to gather and collate high-quality data, properly analyze the data, and draw conclusions about the costs, effectiveness, and longevity of the preservation action. It is difficult to examine such issues as how long the service life of the bridge/bridge element is extended or what the effects of the various, commonly used preservation actions are on the life cycle costs of bridges. Most conclusions reached by bridge practitioners are on the basis of intuition or simple common sense backed up by some experience. It is difficult to translate these conclusions into coherent and convincing arguments that will persuade legislatures and agency upper management to support and adequately fund aggressive and well planned programs of bridge preservation. The collection of the data necessary to support analysis of the effectiveness and economics of bridge preservation activities should be addressed in a logical sequence, starting with short-term studies of existing data and moving to future data collection that is targeted at specific elements of the performance of bridge preservation actions. The material collected will be organized into a handbook for bridge owners to use as a guide to the most efficient and effective decisions for the maintenance and preservation of bridges. Recommendations will be made on how this guidance should be included in existing or new AASTHO specifications or guidance. The objective of the proposed research is to improve the decision process for setting bridge preservation activities and preparation of guidelines. The research will produce recommendations and a handbook for possible adoption by AASHTO.</abstract>

    <abstract>Fires can cause major disruption to highway operations. Major bridge fires resulting in serious structural damage or collapse are infrequent but are often highlighted in special reports and news articles. There is also an undocumented number of smaller bridge fires occurring throughout the United States each year that cause varying degrees of disruption, repair actions, and maintenance cost. These incidents appear to stem primarily from vehicle (often truck) fires, but bridges have also been damaged by fires in adjacent facilities and from other causes. The recent bridge fires in California, Michigan, and New York have highlighted the need to understand the frequency and severity of these incidents as well as to review available information on mitigation strategies, damage assessments, and repair techniques. Research is needed to provide highway bridge owners with mitigation strategies, post event assessments, and repair techniques associated with bridge fires. Such research could lead to American Association of State Highway &amp;amp; Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines for planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and inspecting highway bridges; guidelines for emergency management; and guidelines for a risk-based management approach for bridge safety inspection and maintenance. The objectives of this research are to (1) investigate the susceptibility of highway bridges to fire damage (e.g., by material and design types, geometry, and fire load); (2) develop guidance for damage assessment and repair techniques; and (3) develop guidance for reducing the risk of fire damage. The research should include a comprehensive literature survey and the critical review of standards, technology, and other information. No physical testing is anticipated.</abstract>

    <abstract>In the past decade, Los Alamos National Laboratories has evaluated six non-destructive damage detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect and locate damage on bridges. While significant at the time, the state of the art has evolved such that damage cannot only be detected and located, it can also be quantified. Although numerous damage detection algorithms exist to detect a change in the structure, that information by itself is of little value to a state bridge engineer. What is needed is a structural health monitoring (SHM) system capable of evaluating the structural capacity and remaining service life of a bridge. The ultimate objective of this project is to integrate a damage detection algorithm capable of evaluating a bridge's structural capacity and estimating remaining service life into a structural health monitoring system.</abstract>

    <abstract>Several bridges are constructed with cast-in-place concrete on steel girders, and many of these concrete decks have severely deteriorated with exposed and rusted rebar as a result of exposure to deicing salt. The steel girders and the substructure on many of these bridges are generally still in good condition. Under the sponsorship of the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) and following several years of R&amp;amp;D, the design, implementation, and testing of an alternative to concrete deck replacement have been completed. The system consists of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) honeycomb sandwich panels with either proper steel post or precast concrete guardrails. Although FRP deck panels were already designed, tested, and considered earlier, they could not be used until acceptable bridge railing systems has been completed in summer 2009. A system of precast, vertical-faced, concrete barriers fastened to the deck panels by a specifically designed attachment using anchor rods, plate washers, and nuts, was tested at the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility (MwRSF) in Lincoln, Nebraska. The system met the Test Level 3 (TL-3) evaluation criteria specified in the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). A system of steel thrie beams/rails with steel posts, which was previously crash-tested successfully in 2005 and recommended for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval in accordance with the test Level 4 (TL-4) criteria of CHIRP Report No. 350, presents another viable option for guardrails.</abstract>

    <abstract>Michigan Technological University's Michigan Tech Transportation Institute (MTTI) and Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI), in cooperation with the Center for Automotive Research and the Michigan Department of Transportation, are undertaking a project for the United Stated Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration that will explore the use of remote sensing technologies to assess and monitor the condition of bridge infrastructure and improve the efficiency of inspection, repair, and rehabilitation efforts. This investigation will build on existing work that places sensors directly on the bridge structure to assess deterioration and damage. Remote sensing technologies will be correlated with in-place sensors to obtain bridge condition assessment data without the need to place heavy instrumentation on the structure. This information will then be analyzed by a computer decision support system to develop unique signatures of bridge condition. Monitoring how these signatures change over time will provide state and local engineers with additional information used to prioritize critical maintenance and repair of our nation's bridges. The ability to acquire this information remotely from many bridges without the expense of a dense sensor network will provide more accurate and near real-time assessments of bridge condition. Improved assessments allow for limited resources to be better allocated in repair and maintenance efforts, thereby extending the service life and safety of bridge assets, and minimizing costs of service-life extension.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bridges in the USA have been an integral part of the Interstate Highway System growth. Until the mid to late 1970s, all steel bridges were protected from corrosion by paint coatings containing lead and chromate. The majority of the steel bridges in the interstate system were constructed between 1950 and 1980. Most of these structures have paint coatings containing lead and chromate (FHWA-RD-89-127). A large percentage of the existing steel bridges are currently reaching a critical level of deterioration. The expenses for rehabilitation of these bridges are complicated by the presence of lead based paint because of lead toxicity. More than 90,000 bridges - many in need of repairs - in the United States are coated with lead paint (FHWA-RD-91-100). Lead dust and fumes are released into the air whenever lead paint is disturbed during maintenance, reconstruction, and demolition of bridges and other steel structures. Solid paint waste and paint wash-water is also generated onsite. Because of its toxicity, removing lead paint from bridges and other structures is a major problem facing transportation agencies. While the hazards of lead paint removal from bridges have been identified and enormous advances have been made in the worker protection area, there is still a dire need to identify rapid cost effective methods for lead detection in-situ. Increased levels of expenditure for lead paint removal have resulted over the years. One major problem that still persists is the presence of lead in paint waste removed from bridges and the lead paint remaining on bridges where 100% removal is not achievable. Residual lead can lead to a non lead based paint (LBP) coating becoming hazardous on subsequent removal. Currently the NYSDOT uses a conservative approach of classifying all bridge paint waste from painted bridges constructed before 1988 as hazardous wastes. This practice stems from the fact that there is no approved reliable, fast, and efficient method for classifying paint waste in situ as non hazardous. This conservative practice impacts NYSDOT bridge painting projects resulting in greater expense with increased regulatory hassles. With the advent of more accurate and sophisticated analytical equipment for in-situ field measurements, state DOTs may benefit from research investigating the reliability of such field equipment. In-situ measurements of lead using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) have become the accepted mode of analysis for many federal and state agencies such as U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (USHUD), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Research using field portable XRF meters for lead indicate that the in-situ measurements are extremely accurate and can be used in place of long analytical laboratory analyses. The thermo Scientific NITON XRF- XL3t 700 detector is typically used to conduct non-destructive testing of potential lead-based (along with other metals including RCRA) paint surfaces by USHUD. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing describes the standard operating procedure about the use of the Niton XRF meters (FHWA, 1992). Thermo Scientific NITON x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzers quickly identify and quantify lead in virtually all sample types: paint, soil, sediment, dust, air, and more. Actual metal values are also displayed; permitting users to more accurately quantify the hazards associated with particular samples. Similarly field spectrophotometers are now available for measuring lead concentrations in liquid samples. The HACH DR-2800 field spectrophotometer can be used for field measurements of lead in aqueous samples. The method is USEPA approved and can potentially measure lead concentrations in the range of 3-300 mg/L. The research team will apply the field-portable XRF meters and field spectrophotometers to assess their effectiveness in providing reliable lead concentrations present in bridge paint waste and wash water. These measurements, if reliable, will then be used to classify the waste and/or wastewater as hazardous or non-hazardous. Accuracy of the field measurements will be determined by conducting laboratory analyses using standard inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA) for total metals concentration and comparing to the total metals concentration applying laboratory scale XRF. Further tests shall include the U.S. EPA toxicity leaching characteristic procedure (TCLP) for addressing whether the paint waste is classified as hazardous. Field and laboratory results will then be compared and correlated to develop a model that a state DOT can use to determine if lead based hazardous waste will be generated or not for bridge painting projects.&lt;p&gt;�&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>Existing highway and rail transit tunnels are gradually becoming functionally obsolete and structurally deficient. These structures cause safety concerns.�Older tunnels need frequent inspections, higher levels of maintenance, and rehabilitation.�There is limited experience in the State Departments of Transportation and other tunnel authorities with respect to rehabilitation of existing tunnels.�For these issues, most agencies rely on assistance from bridge engineers or consultants specializing in tunnels.�Rock bolting, grouting, Shotcrete and other techniques have often been used in tunnel rehabilitation.�Other techniques have been used to improve tunnel safety by increasing vertical and horizontal clearances, drainage, extending tunnel portals for rock fall mitigation, tunnel illumination and ventilation. Section 12 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications addresses Buried Structures, but very little guidance is provided for tunnel rehabilitation.�Additional guidance must be developed in a separate stand-alone document on rehabilitation of existing tunnels. Our nation's tunnels are aging, and the increasing traffic volumes and environmental deterioration they experience results in a reduction in their service lives. Guidance should be provided to the engineer to provide cost-effective preventive rehabilitation strategies to preserve existing tunnel structures. Advancements in our knowledge of materials, details, components, structures, and an increased array of construction materials and methods, make it an opportune time to develop solutions to extend the service life and preventing premature deterioration of existing tunnel structures. This problem statement supports "Extending Service Life" and "Optimizing Structural Systems", as noted in the 2005 version of the AASHTO Grand Challenges for strategic planning. The objective of the proposed research is to develop guidelines for rehabilitation of existing highway and rail transit tunnels.�The research focuses on structural aspects of tunnel rehabilitation, drainage, leaking, and safety.</abstract>

    <abstract>Periodic inspection of highway tunnels to assess changes in structural condition over time is critical to timely detection and remediation of problems to ensure road user safety. Tunnel structural problems that are considered widespread and potentially serious are tunnel leaks, concrete cracking, concrete spalling, concrete delamination, debonding, steel corrosion, and improper drainage. Monitoring of tunnel condition and deterioration rate is key to determining the appropriate schedule of maintenance and/or rehabilitation activities to remedy structural and safety problems that might lead to accelerated deterioration and sudden tunnel failures that could cause serious injury and even fatalities. Tunnel inspection is a challenging problem. Tunnels typically service high volume traffic and operate in aggressive environments. Keeping tunnels open during inspection and minimizing tunnel closures and user delays must be carefully balanced with the need to conduct detailed inspections to ensure the safety of drivers. Consequently, nondestructive test methods that are automated, quantitative, and rapid, and that provide complete coverage compared to conventional visual inspections need to be identified and evaluated. However, there does not appear to be any high-speed nondestructive (NDT) testing method for assessing the condition of tunnel linings that would minimize the disruption of ongoing traffic.</abstract>

    <abstract>Epoxy adhesive anchor systems have widespread use throughout the world. They are used to anchor both threaded rods and reinforcing bar into hardened concrete. Common transportation applications for epoxy adhesive anchor systems include bridge widening, structure-mounted signs and appurtenances, luminaires and light poles, concrete repair and rehabilitation, barrier retrofitting, utility installation on existing structures, and tunneling finishing. In July 2006, a section of a suspended concrete ceiling failed and collapsed in the D Street Portal of the Interstate 90 connecter tunnel (part of the "Big Dig") in Boston, Massachusetts. This was a rapid and catastrophic failure that resulted in the loss of life. In July 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a report tracing the cause of this collapse to the failure of epoxy bonded anchors that held the suspended ceiling in place (SB-07-36). NTSB cited a poor creep resistance of the epoxy resin and a general lack of understanding and knowledge about creep in adhesive anchoring systems. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Epoxy bonding systems have widespread use throughout the world. These systems are used to anchor both threaded rods and reinforcing bar into hardened concrete. Common transportation applications for epoxy bonded anchors include bridge widening, concrete repair and rehabilitation, barrier retrofitting, utility installation on existing structures, and tunneling. Despite widespread use, the suppliers of these systems provide little guidance on how the adhesives perform under sustained, long-term loading. The long-term behavior needs further investigation to prevent failures like the one in Boston. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Finally, the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification doesn't adequately address the use of epoxy adhesive anchors. The results of this research will be crucial in the development of appropriate guidelines for AASHTO. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The objectives of this project are the following: (1) through testing and numerical modeling, if needed, document the long-term characteristics of epoxy adhesives currently in use, with emphasis on identifying what levels of sustained loading pose a risk to anchor performance; (2) develop standards and protocols for the testing and use of adhesive anchors in sustained loading applications; (3) provide guidance for future use of adhesive anchors, including (a) identifying the creep performance requirements that are necessary for acceptance of an adhesive anchor system, and (b) developing acceptance criteria that are a function of application, with epoxy anchors not subjected to sustained loading having different acceptance criteria than anchors that will have sustained loading; (4) provide recommendations for agencies for the use of adhesive anchors in sustained loading applications, including (a) how to identify which applications pose a potential risk to the public, (b) inspection and monitoring for anchors posing a potential risk, and (c) retrofit/repair suggestions for anchors posing a potential risk; and (5) provide draft language for addressing the use of epoxy adhesive anchors in the AASTHO LRFD Bridge Design Specification.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>Current bridge inspections are mostly performed by visual inspections that may not reliably identify all defects in a timely manner. Given today's increasingly crowded and aging bridge systems, these inspections can not assure bridge safety and cost-effective maintenance. Intelligent Structure Technology (IST) integrates smart sensors, data acquisition, microprocessor, and communication technology and could identify the presence and extent of damage in bridges. The FHWA has recognized this need and created a framework for Development of Model Structural Health Monitoring Guide for Major Bridges. Several states had started applying this technology into new or existing bridges and refine their bridge inspection. Implementation of intelligent transportation system is an interdisciplinary research frontier for managing transportation system and securing its safety operation. The proposed project is the Phase I of a roadmap towards developing and transferring intelligent damage diagnosis technologies for assessing bridge conditions and supporting decision-making for bridge maintenance in Mississippi. It will focus on research on the detrimental bridge deteriorations in Mississippi and their analytical modeling, transfer of sensing technology to meet the need of bridge inspection in Mississippi, and education on IST for diverse students and professionals.</abstract>

    <abstract>enable the Alaska Department of Transportation (AKDOT) to perform bridge life-cycle cost analysis, per NCHRP Report 483, for the older steel bridges in the Alaska bridge inventory. This objective directly correlates with the draft copy of the AKDOT 2030 plan (http://dot.alaska.gov/stwdplng/areaplans/lrtpp/SWLRTPHome.shtml). However, much of the cost data should also be applicable to bridges of other types (other than 'older steel'). The intent is to study bridges with a substantial history so as to draw 'life-cycle' conclusions.</abstract>

    <abstract>This project will develop and demonstrate the application of a base line-free sensor methodology for real-time monitoring and assessment of post-event integrity and safety of highway bridges. The work will be carried out in two stages. Work in Stage 1 will focus on two main tasks. The first task will involve development of a method for post-event bridge structural damage assessment based on vibration responses measured during the event and structural stiffness and damping identification.�Four different methods as detailed in the proposal will be explored and compared through seismic shaking table tests of a multi-span bridge model. The second task will involve development of a method to estimate the post-event remaining capacity of a bridge based on the structural damage assessment results.�The identified post-event structural stiffness will be used to update the structural model for push-over analysis to allow determination of the remaining capacity of the bridge. Work in Stage 2 will involve software development and field demonstration. The methods for post-event damage assessment and capacity estimation developed in Stage 1 will be packaged into efficient computer algorithms software. The software package will be evaluated using seismic shaking table test results and integrated with an instrumented test bed bridge for long-term evaluation. The final report will document development of the methods and the associated software and provide an assessment of their technical and commercial feasibilities.�An exploratory software package along with a users manual for real-time, remote assessment of damage and evaluation of post-event residual capacity of bridges will also be provided.</abstract>

    <abstract>The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) mandate the frequency and methods used for the safety inspection of highway bridges. The inspection intervals specified in the NBIS require routine inspections to be conducted every 24 months, and that interval may be extended to 4 years for bridges that meet certain criteria and are approved by the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). For bridges with fracture-critical elements, hands-on inspections are required every 2 years. The specified intervals are generally not based on performance of bridge materials or designs, but rather on experience from managing almost 600,000 bridges in the National Bridge Inventory. These inspection intervals are applied to the entire bridge inventory, but they may not be appropriate for all bridges. For example, recently constructed bridges typically experience few problems during their first decade of service and those problems are typically minor.  Under the present requirements, these bridges must have the same inspection frequency and intensity as a 50-year-old bridge that is reaching the end of its service life.  In the case of bridges with fracture-critical elements, newer bridges with improved fabrication processes and designs that mitigate the effects of fatigue are inspected on the same interval and to the same intensity as older bridges that do not share these characteristics. A more rational approach to determine appropriate inspection practices for bridges would consider the structure type, age, condition, importance, environment, loading, prior problems, and other characteristics of the bridge.  There is a growing consensus that these inspection practices should meet two goals: (1) improving the safety and reliability of bridges and (2) optimizing resources for bridge inspection.   These goals can be accomplished through the application of reliability theory. The objective of this project is to develop a recommended bridge inspection practice for consideration for adoption by the American Association of State Highway &amp;amp; Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The practice shall be based on rational methods to ensure bridge safety, serviceability, and effective use of resources.</abstract>

    <abstract>Highway agencies need to evaluate bridge deck condition in order to optimize the effective timing of preventive maintenance, prioritize bridge deck repair and rehabilitation, determine the scope of the required repairs, and make repair/replace decisions. Timing and repair strategies based on nondestructive testing (NDT) results to classify deck condition provide the potential for significant operational improvements. The problem is that deck deterioration frequently takes place below the surface, and cannot be readily evaluated by visual means. Most older decks now have asphalt concrete (AC) or Portland cement concrete (PCC) overlays, making subsurface deterioration conditions even more difficult to detect. Traditional deck inspection methods, such as chain drag, half-cell potentials, and chloride content are slow, require closures, and are not necessarily effective. Over the past 10 years new higher speed technologies such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), infrared thermography, and scanning impact-echo have been developed and implemented to some extent by highway agencies to meet their needs for bridge deck condition assessment. These technologies, however, have not been widely adapted or accepted. Agencies are not fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of these methods, or how they should best be used. Some have had less than positive experiences, possibly due to unrealistic expectations and improper use. &lt;div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>Earth Retaining Structures (ERS) are an often-overlooked but critical class of assets within the nation's surface transportation network. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that each year the United States constructs in excess of 160 million square feet of permanent ERS; some 40 percent are on public road projects. Increasing use of ERS over the past two decades can be directly tied to increased urban development, increased demands for roadway capacity, and construction in terrain made increasingly difficult by development as well as natural profile and geology. It is not uncommon in recent highway construction for a single complex interchange to require several thousand square feet of ERS. Urban transit, rail, and other transportation modes often rely on ERS as well. These retaining structures typically are essential to a transportation project's economically and politically feasible design and reliable long-term performance. Monitoring their condition and assessing needs for maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation require knowledge and experience. The failure of an ERS not only threatens lives and property, but also can seriously disrupt transportation. Although the body of knowledge for ERS design and construction - spanning a broad spectrum of structure types and construction methods - is fairly mature, understanding of the aging and deterioration mechanics and the influence of maintenance activities, methods for routinely assessing ERS condition, and metrics for characterizing and forecasting in-service performance remains primitive. Research is needed to enable transportation agencies to manage their ERS assets effectively, as crucial elements of a transportation system. The objectives of this research are (1) to review the state of practice for management of ERS in transportation systems, (2) to propose a framework for ERS management as a class of transportation system assets, and (3) to identify methods for assessing ERS condition and metrics for characterizing and forecasting in-service performance that agencies can use to apply the management framework. The results of this research should be immediately useful to agencies undertaking to determine their ERS inventory and its condition.</abstract>

    <abstract>The utilization of non-destructive test and monitoring technologies for bridge safety is one of the research focus areas of Hampton University's Eastern Seaboard Intermodal Transportation Applications Center (ESITAC). The objective of the proposed research is to utilize non-destructive testing technology (NDT), in collaboration with Virginia Department of Transportation's (VDOT's) District Structure and Bridge Engineering Department, for accurate, reliable and durable methods of structural health monitoring of highway bridges and to help prevent spread of structural failures. Two bridges have been identified as potential test candidates. The bridge on I-164 at the Coast Guard Blvd. in the City of Portsmouth was built in 1991. According to the 2004 data, the average daily traffic on the bridge is 11,337 with 4% truck traffic. The other bridge is in the city of Williamsburg (VDOT Display structure 018 - 1917). This bridge was built in 1939 and has an average daily traffic of 2230 but with 5% daily average of truck traffic. Metal and non-metal bridge structure components will be investigated using NDT of acoustic emission (AE). The major deliverables from the proposed research will include the following:�(1) Establish inspection procedures and methodology based on the studies during lean and peak traffic intervals. Investigate the role of thermal factors and incorporate them in the inspection procedures.�(2) Provide analysis and research procedures including simple bridge health grading criteria.�(3) Simplify the AE technology application for Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) data review and decision making such that if problems are identified with AE, a dedicated system could be put into place for online monitoring.</abstract>

    <abstract>Historically, durability has been a problem for some individual bridge components, such as bridge bearings, deck joints, and columns and piles. This problem is not unique to the United States. Recent bridge management data from the Netherlands confirms that joints and bearings are the leading maintenance costs for highway bridges. When one component undergoes deterioration at a faster rate than other bridge components, it requires repair, rehabilitation, or even replacement. If these weaker components could be designed with enhanced durability characteristics, or if they could be hardened, protected, or eliminated, disruptions may well be significantly reduced.�The resulting structures could be expected to last longer before they undergo additional renewal efforts.</abstract>

    <abstract>This IDEA project develops an optical fiber sensor system that represents a novel integration of the moire phenomena and fiber optics to achieve a uniquely high sensitivity and robust performance in addition to its easy installation/cabling and immunity to electromagnetic interference and lightning strikes. Upon simple modification, this sensor can measure a variety of dynamic responses of a bridge, including acceleration and displacement under traffic, earthquake and other dynamic loads. The measured structural vibration data can be used to identify structural damage and evaluate remaining capacity in real time to enhance the safety of highway bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Significant maintenance costs are extended nationwide each year for coating structural steel bridge elements in an effort to protect them from corrosion and deterioration. Coating of structural steel presents a significant, costly maintenance challenge that is critical to mitigating the detrimental effects of corrosion to extend the service life of bridges and reduce operational costs. The field performance of coating can be inconsistent, being affected by the quality and method of surface preparation, the environment surrounding the bridge, presence of chlorides and corrosion products (which may be entrapped between plates in built-up members or other details that cannot be cleaned), the type of coating utilized and other factors. The goal of this study is to identify the most cost effective coating for protecting structural steel from corrosion, with consideration of factors such as ease of installation, long-term performance and costs.</abstract>

    <abstract>Precast-prestressed concrete panels are commonly used in the construction of concrete bridge decks. Almost all prefabricated bridge decks in Missouri Department of Transportation's (MoDOT's) inventory consist of precast-prestressed 3" thick deck panels and cast-in-place 5.5" thick slabs on top of the panels. The precast-prestressed concrete panels serve as formwork for the cast-in-place concrete slabs and accelerate the construction of bridge decks in a cost-effective way. Traditionally these panels are reinforced with mild steel temperature reinforcement in the traffic direction along with low-relaxation seven wire steel prestressing strands perpendicular to the traffic direction (along the length of the panel). It was recently observed that some bridges in MoDOT inventory have experienced rusting of embedded steel reinforcement and concrete spalling issues in deck panels. The plausible reasons for spalling observed in many bridges currently in service likely include corrosion of the steel in the panels due to use of deicing salts, permeability/cracking in the panels, and inadequate concrete cover. Corrosion of steel reinforcement can be detrimental as it can result in shorter life spans for the deck panels. Since the use of stay-in-place deck panels has proven to be a very cost-effective practice for concrete bridge deck constructions in Missouri, it is of interest to examine ways to mitigate spalling and the resulting service-life reduction associated with corrosion of embedded reinforcement in these panels. Hence an investigation of the causes and development of solutions including alternate design options for these panels will have a significant economic impact on MoDOT bridge construction practices. Further, as steel reinforcing bar prices continue climbing and more rusting/spalling issues appear, eliminating the steel in these panels could become cost effective. The idea proposed in this project is to replace the steel reinforcement, both prestressed and nonprestressed, by fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars and perform experimental testing of these panels to evaluate their long-term structural performance.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Boston-Norfolk (BOSFOLK) corridor is a major transportation corridor in the northeast, the main artery of which is Interstate-95 (I-95). With construction initiating in the 1960's, many of the bridges on I-95 and in the corridor are nearing the end of their design life. This presents a unique opportunity to study the long-term performance of bridge on a major heavily traveled corridor. The questions can be asked - How resilient were the bridges in the BOSFOLK corridor? And - How did the bridges on I-95 perform compared to those not on the I-95 corridor? The study will specifically examine the historic resiliency of bridges in the corridor. It will be done through a systematic investigation of historic data from the National Bridge Inventory database.</abstract>

    <abstract>Work completed under a previous contract with the Iowa Highway Research Board involved the structural health monitoring (SHM) of steel bridges. One part of this work was the design and implementation of continuous SHM systems. One system was developed to continuously monitor bridge performance under ambient traffic loads and to detect gradual deterioration and sudden damage--specifically for fracture critical bridges but with likely application to multiple bridge types. The second system was developed specifically with secondary road brides in mind. The goal of this study is to validate the SHM systems' damage (and deterioration) detection ability by implementing and installing sacrificial elements on a 3-span highway bridge carrying US 30 over the Skunk River near Ames, Iowa. The primary objectives include (1) Demonstration and validation of damage detection capability of the previously developed SHM systems. (2) Advancement of the state-of-the-art and improvement in Iowa bridge owners' expertise in design, installation, effectiveness of SHM system. (3) Implementation of the validated SHM systems on other bridges.</abstract>

    <abstract>The proposed research will develop the application of Raman Spectroscopy as a nondestructive evaluation tool for the condition assessment of carbon fiber composites. Composite materials are increasingly being used in engineered structures and components, ranging from highway bridges to airframes and pressure vessels. These materials have a high strength to mass ratio, making them ideal materials for inclusion in space vehicles, hydrogen cars and aircraft. There exists a critical need to develop nondestructive evaluation technologies that can be used to assess the condition of these materials in-situ, such that components and systems can be managed and repaired during their service lives. To date, NDE technologies developed for the inspection of composite materials have focused on mechanical damage scenarios, such as impact and fatigue. There is growing concern that environmental degradation of these materials leads to reduced strength during their service lives, and presently there are no NDE technologies capable of characterizing the degradation of composite materials in-situ. The proposed research will investigate if Raman spectroscopy can be used for the condition assessment of composite materials during their service lives. Raman spectroscopy is a laser technique that is sensitive to molecular interactions in ordered materials such as graphite and carbon fibers. For carbon materials, the technique has been shown to be sensitive to applied elastic stresses and structural order on a molecular level. Traditionally a laboratory technique, new instrumentation implementing fiber-optic probes has extended the potential for this technology beyond the laboratory. The potential exist for implementation as a hand-held device for the inspection of engineering components and structures, including bridges and hydrogen vehicles.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objectives of this research is to investigate the long-term deteriorating effect of vehicular wheel loading relative to that of environmental loading on Caltrans reinforced concrete bridge decks, as well as to look into the long-term effectiveness of Caltrans' preservation and rehabilitation strategies for concrete bridge decks. Caltrans currently employs high molecular weight methacrylate (HMWM)-based crack sealing and polyester overlay. This research will also explore the value of Portland cement concrete (PCC) and asphalt concrete (AC) overlays on bridge decks, and identify the appropriate treatment time and frequency for these strategies.</abstract>

    <abstract>Highway infrastructure across North America is characterized by a huge inventory of damaged and decaying culverts. The cost of culvert replacement is high, and disruption to highway traffic makes conventional trench excavation undesirable. Culvert repair without trench excavation avoids problems experienced by pavements reconstructed over consolidating trench backfill. Many pipe relining techniques have been developed to restore the hydraulic and/or structural integrity of culvert structures, and the use of these methods has increased significantly in recent years. Liners are cast in place, or pre-formed liners may be pulled into place through the culvert and grout is pumped behind the preformed liner. Methods have also been developed to undertake localized repairs, restore the integrity of the backfill behind the culvert, and repair voids caused by soil erosion. Repair methodologies are largely driven by specialist contractors, while engineers representing infrastructure owners (structural and geotechnical consultants) generally have limited experience with these systems. Others have questions regarding the extent to which earth loads and vehicle loads reach a localized repair or full length liner. Questions also remain regarding the effect of ground loss behind repaired culverts, and circumstances requiring repair of soil voids, rather than focusing repair efforts on the culvert structure alone. As such, research was needed to (a) investigate techniques of localized or full-length culvert rehabilitation and (b) develop design procedures for cost-effective rehabilitation techniques that extend service life while avoiding disruption to traffic. Research was performed under NCHRP Project 14-19 by the Louisiana Tech University to develop a handbook that provides up-to-date guidance to assess the existing condition of culverts; provides assistance in the selection and design of suitable rehabilitation options; and provides information on various methods of construction associated with culvert rehabilitation. The products developed under the Phase I are: (1) an extensive literature review related to culvert rehabilitation and (2) interactive charts that enable users to identify applicable rehabilitation methods for defective culverts. The charts lay out a decision process for selecting assessment and rehabilitation methods that are grouped by: culvert materials: concrete, metal, and thermoplastic; and deficiency types: lacking structural stability, exhibiting bedding deficiencies, and lacking hydraulic capacity. Both products are available at: http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/project14-19/index.html. The handbook will be available after completing the Phase II under NCHRP Project 14-19A.

    <abstract>STATEMENT OF NEED: A box beam structure recently collapsed in Pennsylvania.  This structure type represents approximately 10% of the total square footage of the Department's bridge inventory.  More information is needed to inspect, rate and manage the Department's inventory of precast box beam structures.    OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to obtain field samples, perform material and strength testing as described below to create a proportional relationship between visual observations, inspection rating, and structural analysis modeling for load capacity.  RESEARCH TASKS: 1) Document and measure visual observations. 2) Transport, test, and dispose of seven beams. 3) Perform full scale load testing to failure on four beams. 4) Test six more cross sectional beam sections from beams not load tested. 5) Collate deterioration data and full scale test information to develop a structural analysis model for load capacity. 6) Recommend changes to the Department's current inspection practices.  DELIVERABLES: Recommendations of changes to inspection practices and reports as required.</abstract>

    <abstract>OVERALL RESEARCH OBJECTIVE The objectives of this program are to develop and promote advanced structural health monitoring (SHM) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques among transportation infrastructure owners. These techniques allow owners to improve their ability to determine infrastructure condition and maximize useful life through quantitative and repeatable measurements of critical engineering quantities. A major focus of the Research Engineering Group (REG) effort is on bridges. However, the research has been and will continue to be applied to other critical infrastructure components whenever a technology can be matched to a need. Our nation is faced with infrastructure needs in excess of currently allocated resources. Improved communication of best practices and new technologies - such as structural health monitoring - will help infrastructure owners to preserve and maintain our transportation network. The REG's field research activities and interactions with practitioners specifically address: &amp;amp;#61623; USDOT goals for safety, &amp;amp;#61623; National Strategy for Surface Transportation Research goals for safety, maintenance, and rehabilitation of highway structures, and &amp;amp;#61623; Federal Transit Agency - Advanced Transportation Research basic research focus. PROGRESS AND CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH OVERVIEW The REG has made substantial progress with the research goals outlined in our SAFETEA-LU Year 4 proposal. However, not all research priorities have been addressed during these first eight months of work. Two tasks from our year 4 proposal have yet to begin, the work with Metro North Railroad and Caltrans. We are still in active negotiations with those partners and expect to begin work summer 2011. This is normal and expected due to the variable nature of our deployment partners' schedules and priorities. We have adapted to conditions and thus far focused resources on the work described below: 1) The REG has re-installed and expanded the SHM system at the bearing assembly on the I-65 JFK Bridge in Louisville, Kentucky. The third retrofit was installed in early 2011when we applied new instrumentation and monitored the installation process. 2) The USH-2 Montreal River Bridge monitoring system in Hurley, Wisconsin was maintained and the data being gathered continues to be analyzed by NU students and faculty. REG engineers presented the finished project website to WisDoT in December 2011at their Madison Wisconsin headquarters and also provided training in the use of its live and historical data display tools. 3) The CTA Devon and Sheridan Road El overpass monitoring system and project data website were completed. The site continues to be maintained and the data being gathered continues to be analyzed by NU students and faculty. REG 3 engineers presented the finished project website to the CTA in September 2011 at their downtown Chicago headquarters and also provided training in the use of its live and historical data display tools. The work was also featured in a November 28th , 2011 Chicago Tribune article. 4) We support Midwest Bridge Working Group meetings with technical assistance, presentations, and participation in discussions. The 2010 winter conference was videotaped and archived for on demand viewing while the upcoming Spring 2011 meeting will be webcast live and archived for on demand viewing. 5) We provided support for Civil Engineering student activities, such as field excursions and the CAD class (GEN_ENG 220) A completely new task not listed in the Year 4 proposal was also completed this year. Based on prior ITI work with the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) using continuously monitored tiltmeters for scour mitigation, ITI engineers were invited to tour five scour prone bridges in California and to propose new monitoring solutions. REG engineers proposed a wireless tiltmeter system and selected the Trancas Creek bridge in Malibu California, which is scheduled for installation summer 2011. While touring the bridges with CalTrans engineers we learned that although California implemented the ITI developed tiltmeter based scour monitoring technique statewide, their inhouse data management was troubled. REG engineers offered to immediately demonstrate our web based data management techniques again by posting the CalTrans collected data. As of this writing, ITI is providing an improved web based scour data display for ten bridges state wide in parallel with the CalTrans system.</abstract>

    <abstract>Background: At the Center for Quality Engineering and Failure Prevention at Northwestern, we have been developing intelligent SHM systems for aircraft and marine structure applications for the past two decades.  ITI has been a leader in developing and implementing technological solutions to civil infrastructure maintenance problems.  In September 2007, CQE initiated a new NSF-funded five-year effort to establish a network of centers program called Partnerships for International Research and Education: Intelligent Structural Health Management (PIRE-ISHM) of Safety-Critical Aerospace, Mechanical and Civil Structures.  The effort on the civil infrastructure side is in conjunction with ITI support.  As described in the NSF PIRE-ISHM proposal document, we envisage collaborative activities with ITI in research, education and outreach.    Research Theme: Whatever the actual causes of catastrophic failures such as the I35W Bridge in Minneapolis, it is clear that an aggressive Structural Health Management (SHM) approach including schedule-based off-line inspection and on demand on-line inspection is necessary to prevent such disasters.  In schedule-based off-line inspection (as currently practiced), diagnostic equipment and sensors are temporarily placed on the bridge at prescribed intervals for scheduled measurements.  On-demand (or continuous) on-line inspection, on the other hand, is carried out with permanently installed sensors for what is known as structural health monitoring.     We propose to consider both schedule-based inspection and structural health monitoring.  These techniques have certain equipment features in common, but there are also significant differences.  At the present time, the experience that has been gained with schedule-based inspection is considered to provide major advantages, but the potential economic and safety benefits of structural health monitoring are potentially so significant that future structures are likely to include SHM as part of a robust structural health management program.  It is noteworthy that the need for an active approach to structural health management has been recognized by the Transportation Research Board in a document entitled Research Needs Statement [1].  The specific research goals that the proposed SHM program addresses include Safety (USDOT), Infrastructure Renewal especially safety assurance of highway structures (NSSTR goal), and Advanced Transportation Research (FTAR goal).

    <abstract>Concrete transportation structures are subject to cracking that leads to deterioration--corrosion, weakening due to sulfate attack, and damage from alkali-silica reactivity. These problems shorten the service lives of bridges, tunnels, and pavements and reduce their level of performance. The goal of this EAR project is to design concretes with increased resistance to cracking. Paradoxically, one method proposed introduces controlled cracking on a nano to micrometer scale to lower the tensile stresses in concrete to a level where they will not cause macroscale cracking or curling. This relaxation would be induced by utilizing stress-relaxing cementitious composites (SRCCs), which are achieved by embedding nano to micrometer scale inclusions that reduce the concrete's brittleness without sacrificing its strength.   Previous attempts to limit cracking have focused mainly on cracking caused by shrinkage and have included reducing the water-to-cementitious-materials ratio, using mineral admixtures, and adding shrinkage-reducing admixtures. The SRCC approach in this project, however, will address not only cracks caused by shrinkage but also those related to thermal changes, expansive corrosion reactions, ASR expansions, and other causes.  To maximize the prospects of success, the Exploratory Advanced Research (EAR) Program study will investigate SRCCs on two scales, using two models. On the nano to micrometer scale, materials being explored include surface-treated carbon nanotubes, silica fume, metakaolin, fly ash, limestone powder, and rice husk ash. The stress-relaxation effect of these materials occurs as nano (or micro) cracks form at the interface of the cement paste matrix molecules and the embedded SRCC molecules, releasing energy. After crack formation, further relaxation results from sliding friction at the interface.  On the micrometer to millimeter scale, various types of waste plastic are being investigated for their ability to increase concrete's visco-elasticity. Should this method prove successful and be widely adopted, it could benefit the environment tremendously. Plastics occupy about 25 percent of the total volume of landfills, and their manufacture consumes about 10 percent of the country's total fossil fuel use. Only 5 percent of plastics produced in the United States are now recycled.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this project is to improve existing systems, subsystems, and components that historically limit the service life of bridges, and to identify and prove promising concepts for alternative systems, subsystems, and components. During the investigative phase of this project, the research team shall consider all bridge span lengths. However, the outcome of this project should focus on typical bridges, for example, bridges with one or multiple spans, with a maximum single span length of 300 feet.</abstract>

Since then, it has been employed by a number of state departments of transportation (DOTs) on bridges that experienced reinforcing steel corrosion due to deicing salts or marine exposure (or both).�&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;�&lt;/span&gt;While earlier cathodic protection installations on bridges were of the impressed current type, significant advances have been made in the past decade in adapting galvanic systems, which are simpler and more easily maintained, for substructures in particular.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;� &lt;/span&gt;Results, however, have been mixed, with some states employing cathodic protection extensively and others only on a limited basis or not at all. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: black"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The widely differing levels of usage may be due to such factors as 1) Initial and ongoing costs; 2) the technology, including design, installation, and maintenance is not understood by many highway personnel; 3) instances of inadequate performance; 4) the absence of a protocol for deciding when to use cathodic protection, considering factors such as type of structural element, nature of exposure, extent of corrosion-induced damage in concrete, desired service life, etc; and 5) the wide array and evolution of materials and instrumentation available in the marketplace. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: black"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;A synthesis is needed to examine the utility of cathodic protection for control of reinforcing steel corrosion and extension of bridge service life.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The main focus of the study is determination of why states do or do not use CP. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>Use of externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) systems for the repair and strengthening of reinforced and prestressed concrete bridge structures has become accepted practice by some state highway agencies because of their technical and economic benefits. Such FRP systems are lightweight, exhibit high tensile strength, and are easy to install; these features facilitate handling and help expedite repair or construction, enhance long-term performance, and result in cost savings. In addition, research has shown that external bonding of FRP composites improves flexural behavior of concrete members and increases the capacity of concrete bents and columns.� In spite of their potential benefits, use of externally bonded FRP systems is hampered by the lack of nationally accepted design specifications for bridges. Research is needed to review available information and develop a recommended guide specification, in AASHTO LRFD format, for the design of externally bonded FRP systems. This specification will help highway agencies consider FRP systems among the options for the repair and strengthening of concrete bridge elements and select options that are expected to yield economic and other benefits. The objective of this research is to develop a recommended guide specification, in AASHTO LRFD format, for the design of externally bonded FRP composite systems for repair and strengthening of reinforced and prestressed concrete highway bridge elements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>A key challenge to managing fixed assets such as bridges and other transportation infrastructure is monitoring their condition over time. Under typical service conditions, deterioration resulting from traffic loading and difficult environmental conditions can result in a reduction or loss of service of a particular asset, or even life threatening and dangerous failures. Extreme events such as earthquakes and floods present a still greater challenge in that the service condition of the asset may change abruptly and without warning, leaving managers without key information they need to respond to the event. The goal of this project is to develop remote health monitoring technology that will provide managers and owners with timely information on the condition of civil infrastructure assets. This will be achieved through the development of an instrumented pile that will provide real-time data on bridge scour and seismic activity, allowing for the remote monitoring of bridge conditions by key managers and engineers.</abstract>

    <abstract>Condition monitoring of transportation assets such as bridge decks is a vital component of a comprehensive asset management plan. Early detection of subsurface deterioration in bridge decks is necessary to forestall the development of dangerous conditions and to plan for repairs and replacement. Currently, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods applied to this problem require direct access to the bridge deck and, therefore, require closure of the lanes. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a NDE method that utilizes sensors placed on the underside of the bridge deck and uses active or passive noise excited from the surface to assess the condition of the deck.</abstract>

    <abstract>Inspections of many of the older culverts currently in use in NJ, both along side and under roadways, have shown a deteriorated condition state.  If this deterioration is not addressed within the next several years, many areas will exhibit soil transfer from under the culvert resulting in erosion and/or collapse.   A culvert collapse may result in the above roadway flooding and settling, or itself collapsing, which would prove very costly in terms of traffic delays and roadway repair. A research study done for NJDOT Maintenance investigated the deterioration of corrugated steel culvert pipes (CSCP).  For this study, CSCP inspection information was linked to the straight line diagrams (SLD) for ease of identification and location of current inspection data across NJ.  NJDOT Maintenance has identified the ability to access and analyze the large amount of culvert data for the drainage system as a significant problem, and recognizes its importance with respect to meeting both GASB-34 asset management requirements and NJDEP storm water management reporting requirements. This study is a demonstration project to develop the tools needed for a future deployment of a large scale Culvert Information Management System (CIMS) which will include many types of culverts.  The CIMS demonstration done for this pilot study and the database created will include several culvert types (steel, concrete, plastic, aluminum, etc.), in different regions of the state, different condition states, and different soils that are representative of the storm water drainage system throughout NJ.</abstract>

    <abstract>Subsurface deterioration in concrete structures presents a significant challenge for inspection and maintenance engineers. Cracking, delaminations and spalling that can occur as a result of corrosion of embedded reinforcing steel can lead to pot holes and even punch-through in concrete decks. For overpass bridges, concrete can separate from the structure and fall into traffic below the bridge, and there have been numerous deadly accidents as a result. Although this deterioration can frequently be detected using hammer sounding and/or chain dragging, these inspection techniques require hands-on access to the surface of the concrete. For both overpass bridges and decks, lane closures are required to gain access to the structure, and the resulting traffic disruptions makes inspections expensive and logistically difficult. The proposed research would explore the use of hand-held infrared cameras for the remote detection of deterioration in concrete. This technology could reduce the need for lane closures and improve the ability of inspection and maintenance personnel to detect and monitor deterioration in its embryonic stages, such that maintenance procedures can be employed before deterioration becomes critical. The technology can also be used to monitor and improve concrete repairs by rapidly identifying the extent of deterioration and locating its boundaries.</abstract>

    <abstract>New deck systems, such as steel grid and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) on stringers and floor beams, were introduced in recent years and are now finding increased use because of their lighter weight and ability to increase live load capacity without the need for costly superstructure and substructure strengthening. Because these decks differ from conventional decks, different criteria must be stipulated for their design to ensure serviceability and performance. Also, different testing procedures may be required to evaluate and validate deck designs. Current design criteria are based on limited analytical and experimental studies that might disregard some key factors associated with the design of these new systems. Also, current testing procedures may provide appropriate guidance relative to conventional bridge decks but may not adequately address the design elements or materials used in newly developed deck systems.  In spite of their potential benefits, the use of new and innovative bridge decks is hampered by the lack of adequate information on their design criteria and appropriate testing procedures for deck evaluation. Research is needed to identify the factors that influence strength, durability, and long-term performance of bridge decks and to recommend rational design criteria and testing procedures applicable to a variety of decks. These criteria and procedures will provide highway agencies with the information necessary for evaluating bridge deck options and making rational decisions regarding their acceptance and use.  The objectives of this research are to recommend design criteria and testing procedures for bridge decks. These criteria and procedures shall be prepared in a format suitable for consideration and adoption by the American Association of Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as part of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The research shall be limited to steel grid decks, decks using any fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials, and other innovative bridge decks on stringers and/or floor beams.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concrete is a primary construction material for infrastructure in the United States. The ability to effectively assess the condition of concrete structures during their service life is critically important to maintaining the safety and efficiency of our infrastructure. Corrosion of reinforcing steel bars and strands that are embedded in the concrete is a primary deterioration mode for structures across the spectrum of the civil infrastructure. The Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to be developed under the proposed project can help address the need for improved condition assessment tools, by allowing a concrete structure to be built with an embedded acoustic sensor network. The embedded sensors will be capable of detecting corrosion, cracking in concrete, and fracture of embedded steel such as reinforcing steel and prestressing strand. This technology will lead to a "smart bridge" that has an embedded sensor network that is analogous to the nervous system in the human body, detecting deterioration in its embryonic stages such that mitigation methods can be employed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop improved sensor designs for magnetostrictive EMATs that will overcome limitations in the current sensors designs, allowing for the sensors to be embedded in concrete. The improved design and design models to be developed under this project will broaden the scope of application for this unique sensor technology for the condition assessment of bridges and other civil structures.</abstract>

    <abstract>Transportation agencies expend resources to ensure that all longitudinal barriers meet the safety performance guidelines to which they were constructed. Barrier systems are damaged by a wide variety of activities and factors, including minor crashes, snow plowing, mowing operations, and deterioration due to environmental conditions. Such damage may or may not be repaired by maintenance forces. For example, snowplows often bend W-beam guardrails and sometimes bend or break the posts. Even seemingly insignificant barrier damage or deterioration may compromise a barrier's safety performance.   With limited maintenance budgets, state highway agencies often have large backlogs of needed safety-feature repairs. These agencies cannot afford to repair damage that does not alter a barrier's safety performance, but significant barrier damage must be repaired to provide adequate protection for the motoring public. Unfortunately, in the absence of objective criteria for determining when repair is not required, highway agencies may be held to the unachievable standard of maintaining all safety features in as-built condition to avoid tort liability. Therefore, there is a need for objective, quantitative criteria in the form of guidelines for assessing damage and deterioration and determining when a longitudinal barrier requires repair or can remain in service. The objective of this project is to develop guidelines to assist maintenance personnel in identifying the levels of damage and deterioration to longitudinal barriers that require repairs to restore operational performance. The guidelines will assist the user in identifying longitudinal barriers and their components that require replacement or repair. Quantitative-based guidelines should be developed for semi-rigid and flexible barrier systems. The project should focus on longitudinal barriers within the length-of-need. It is expected that the study may include mathematical analysis, simulation, or full-scale crash testing to develop a correlation between the various levels of damage and deterioration and the degree of operational degradation to different types of barrier systems. Interactions between various types of damage and deterioration should also be considered. Key analysis findings developed under this project need to be validated.</abstract>

    <abstract>A variety of maintenance actions are performed by highway agencies to preserve highway bridges. Although similar maintenance actions are applied, applications methods, rates, bases of measurement, costs, performance, and other related factors differ among these agencies. There is no widely accepted system for uniformly recording data pertaining to maintenance actions. Research is needed to review relevant information; recommend uniform definitions of the data associated with maintenance actions, and develop a database system for collection, storage, and retrieval of related data. These definitions and the database system will ensure proper interpretation of the data, facilitate their use by highway agencies in evaluating cost and performance of alternative maintenance applications, and provide a basis for cost-benefit analysis and evaluation of cost and deterioration models. These products will provide for maximum sharing and use of bridge-maintenance data and will help highway agencies make appropriate adjustments to improve performance or reduce cost of maintenance actions, thereby effectively managing bridge-maintenance resources and achieving the best possible value for the public dollar. The objective of this research was to develop a national database system of bridge-maintenance actions, materials, and methods, and their effectiveness to provide a means for establishing a record of actions that includes uniform descriptions of maintenance activities, bases of measurement, costs, impacts, performance, and other relevant data for use in cost-benefit analysis, selection of maintenance actions, or other related decisions. It was envisioned that the database system will be made adaptable for web-based application in a future project.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concrete beams can be repaired and strengthened with externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite sheets or prefabricated CFRP laminates. The short-term behavior of these applications has been studied, and construction specifications for bonded repair were developed under NCHRP Project 10-59A. Nevertheless, research into their long-term performance is incomplete, and durability issues remain unanswered.  Proper use of CFRP systems requires knowledge of their durability. The effect of mechanical and environmental loading on bonded CFRP systems may be significant. The development of design guidelines and material selection criteria that consider the effects of mechanical and environmental loads on durability will permit designers to repair or strengthen structures more effectively. The research may identify dominant factors that need to be monitored to evaluate the condition of CFRP applications. The results of this study may also be applicable to evaluation of the durability of existing installations.  The objective of this project is to develop design guidelines and material selection criteria that consider the effects of mechanical and environmental loads on the durability of bonded CFRP repair and strengthening of concrete beams.</abstract>

    <abstract>There are approximately 580,000 bridges in the FHWA National Bridge Inventory (NBI). The NBI is a collection of key information used to identify and characterize the type, usage, size, location, and condition of bridges in the United States. Approximately 90,000 of the bridges in the NBI have been identified as having unknown foundations. Because of inadequate foundation information, expensive bridge countermeasures are often implemented even though they may not be necessary. However, taking no action at all may involve unacceptable risk. Current methods to investigate unknown foundations are limited and costly. Bridge owners know intuitively that it is often prudent to use countermeasures, monitor sites, or even take the risk of failure rather than use limited resources for costly foundation investigations, especially for bridges with limited remaining service life. Risk-based guidelines are needed to assist bridge owners in determining when a detailed foundation investigation is warranted. If an investigation is warranted, guidelines are needed to assist bridge owners in determining the type of investigation to be conducted considering the applicability and costs of various investigation techniques. If an investigation is not warranted, guidelines are needed to assist bridge owners in determining if a hydraulic or structural countermeasure is warranted, and if so, the level of protection commensurate with the estimated risks.  The objective of this research is to develop risk-based guidelines to assist bridge owners in evaluating and prioritizing various courses of action (i.e., investigations, countermeasures, monitoring, rehabilitation, or replacement) for managing bridges with unknown foundations.</abstract>

    <abstract>South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) submitted a successful application for $330,000 in funding as part of the TEA-21 Innovative Bridge Construction Program. This research is designed to meet the evaluation requirements of this experimental bridge construction. Four new bridges-50-177-199, 50-178-199; 50-175-207, 50-176-207-have been selected for inclusion in the research as part of IM29-3(38)79 PCEMS A443 in Minnehaha County. The bridges include: &amp;amp;bull; Madison Street over I-29: two 3-span steel girder bridges, each 374' x 56' roadway; &amp;amp;bull; I-29 over a railroad Two single-span steel girder brides, one 94' x 93.5' roadway and another 94' x 83.5' roadway. The intent is to use corrosion resistant 316L clad reinforcing steel bar in one set of bridges and corrosion resistant 2205 duplex stainless steel reinforcement in the other set. This will be in conjunction with low permeability, optimized gradation concrete for the decks. This combination of materials will combine application of three recent SDDOT research efforts to: optimize fly ash content for low permeability (SD2000-06); optimize aggregate gradation to provide strength while minimizing shrinkage cracking SD2002-02); and use non-corrosive, stainless steel clad reinforcing steel (SD2002-16). The goal of this combination is a design for new bridge decks that can reliably achieve a 75-year life with minimal deck maintenance. This research addresses the evaluation of the innovative construction materials used and the initial performance of the structures. Research Objectives: 1. Determine the constructability of the bridge decks with the optimized concrete mixture and corrosion-resistant reinforcement. 2. Evaluate the performance of the bridge decks especially with respect to cracking frequency. 3. Assess the overall benefits of the optimized bridge decks with respect to achieving a 75-year life. Research Tasks: 1. Develop a work plan incorporating previous SDDOT and other research results for monitoring construction and evaluating performance of the experimental bridges. 2. Verify duplex and stainless clad reinforcement physical properties through appropriate routine testing. 3. Document the concrete mixture design and physical properties for the proposed optimized mixture. 4. Monitor construction of the four bridge decks, determine as-delivered reinforcement properties (dimension, cladding thickness, physical tests) and record all concrete mixture test results. 5. Conduct an extensive cracking and condition survey on each bridge prior to its being opened to traffic. 6. Submit an interim construction and initial evaluation report on the four bridges. 7. Conduct permeability and other appropriate testing on each bridge at 28 days, 1 year and 2 years after construction. 8. Perform and report on interim evaluations at 6 months, 1 year and two years after construction is complete. 9. Analyze economic and other benefits of the optimized bridge deck design. 10. Prepare a final report and executive summary of the prior research, research methodology, findings, conclusions and recommendations. 11. Make an executive presentation to the SDDOT Research Review Board at the conclusion of the project.</abstract>

    <abstract>The ongoing problem of corrosion of reinforcing steel in bridge decks has been addressed in South Dakota with increased concrete cover over reinforcement and the use of epoxy-coated rebar (ECR). To date, these measures appear to have worked well extending bridge deck life significantly. With the development of new materials and technologies, there maybe a potential for increasing deck life and/or reducing the amount of concrete cover on bridge decks. One of these new materials is a 316L stainless steel clad reinforcement manufactured by using a metallizing technique called the Osprey Process. This clad steel may be much less susceptible to corrosion than black steel or ECR, and may provide the means of preventing corrosion caused by deicing salts from occurring throughout the life of a structure. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential corrosion resistance, mechanical properties and uniformity of the SMI-316 SC&amp;amp;Ocirc; using laboratory tests. Based on the results of these tests, South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) may design, construct and evaluate a bridge deck reinforced with this Corrosion-Resistant Steel. All test results will be compared with those from epoxy-coated reinforcement and mild steel using the same protocols developed in SD2001-05 Evaluation of Corrosion-Resistant Reinforcing Steel. The research will provide information on the constructability and effectiveness of this Corrosion-Resistant Steel for use in bridge decks as well as performance, service life and cost-effectiveness data. The objectives of this research project are to: (1) Determine the corrosion-resistance of the SMI-316 SC&amp;amp;Ocirc; compared to ECR reinforcement; (2) Determine the mechanical properties, quality and suitability of the SMI-316 SC&amp;amp;Ocirc; for use in bridge decks; and (3) Estimate life expectancy and cost effectiveness of the SMI-316 SC&amp;amp;Ocirc;, ECR and mild steel reinforcement in South Dakota.</abstract>

    <abstract>Winter maintenance throughout the United States has undergone a tremendous change during the last decade with a strong shift in materials away from solid chemicals and salt-sand mixtures toward the use of liquid deicing chemicals. This move has been prompted by many factors including increasing public demand for serviceable, even bare pavements, environmental concerns with dust and a concerted effort to find ways to maintain acceptable road conditions while reducing the quantity of chemical being applied. The new emphasis on deicing/anti-icing as a primary strategy has resulted in a substantial increase in the use of concentrated chloride salt solutions both for prewetting and direct application to pavement surfaces. As familiarity and experience grow, more and more liquid chemical is being used with the assumption that there is no fundamental difference in effect using these liquids as there was with the prior use of solid sodium chloride. This may not be the case. Magnesium chloride solution has gained wide acceptance as an important tool in numerous states' winter maintenance programs. Currently, it is being used for deicing, prewetting and anti-icing with great success. The volume of this material being applied annually is rapidly increasing as more maintenance units expand their capabilities. At the same time, the American Concrete Institute states in ACI 515.1R-79 &amp;amp;quot;Magnesium chloride disintegrates concrete slowly&amp;amp;quot; and F.M.Lea, in The Chemistry of Cement and Concrete (third edition, Chemical Publishing Company, New York, page 673), states &amp;amp;quot;Solutions of magnesium chloride of 2% concentration and upwards produce a gradual diminution in the strength of portland cement mortars&amp;amp;quot; and goes on to say &amp;amp;quot;Very strong [about 30%] solutions destroy portland cement concrete.&amp;amp;quot; These views raise questions about the long term effects of applying 28-30 % solution of this chemical, or, indeed, any chemical deicer to bridge decks and PCC pavements, as well as the potential impact to highly permeable new concrete. Calcium and sodium chloride are also being used as concentrated deicing brines, with unknown potential effects on concrete properties. Typical existing research involves testing 2%-4% solutions of deicer for scaling or other adverse effects. These tests assume rapid dilution of these chemicals, which may not be valid, especially where anti-icing is being employed. There is a need to conduct field investigations on concrete treated with liquid deicers over a number of years as well as laboratory research to determine the potential impact of various liquid deicers over the expected duration of treatment. There is also a need to determine whether strategies such as modified concrete mix design or application of sealants can offset any deleterious results. This project is being conducted as Pooled Fund Study TPF-5(042) through the cooperation of the Federal Highway Administration and the financial support of California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, Texas and Wyoming.&amp;amp;nbsp;The objectives of this research project are to: (1) &amp;amp;nbsp;determine the long-term effects of concentrated solutions of magnesium, sodium and calcium chloride as well as CMA or other alternative liquid deicers on durable portland cement concrete; (2) estimate the potential for reduction in performance and service life for pavements (jointed plain, reinforced and continuously reinforced) and structures subjected to various concentrated deicing brines; and (3) identify alternative protective or deicing/anti-icing strategies which minimize potential impacts to durable portland cement concrete while providing acceptable winter maintenance results.</abstract>

    <abstract>With the adoption of its eighth edition, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications, Section 5.13, Anchors, is noted as being applicable to headed studs, headed bolts, certain hooked bolts, adhesive anchors, post installed expansion anchors, and post installed undercut anchors. The design specification references American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318-14, ACI 355.2, and ACI 355.4. These documents cover structural design of anchors and qualification testing for mechanical and adhesive anchors. Many design, materials, and construction engineers in state departments of transportation (DOTs) and the transportation industry may not be familiar with these ACI documents or the proper application of these documents and other related documents for design, specification, procurement, or inspection of the various anchor types.
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-07/Task 255, �Development of a Test Method to Determine the Ability of Adhesive Anchors to Resist Sustained Tensile Load,� and NCHRP Project 04-37, �Long-Term Performance of Epoxy Adhesive Anchor Systems,� conducted extensive research on adhesive anchor systems.
NCHRP Project 20-07/Task 255 (published as NCHRP Report 639: Adhesive Anchors in Concrete Under Sustained Loading Conditions) provided an initial basis for developing AASHTO standards for sustained loads on adhesive anchors in response to recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board to the FHWA, AASHTO, and the state DOTs.
NCHRP Project 04-37 (published as NCHRP Report 757: Long-Term Performance of Epoxy Adhesive Anchor Systems) resulted in a draft specification for design and construction of adhesive anchor systems. NCHRP Report 757 includes a draft workflow process chart to aid agencies in the appropriate selection and specification of adhesive anchors. The report also contains appendices with draft AASHTO standards pertaining to the use of adhesive anchors in concrete including:
(1) Test methods and specifications and material specifications and commentary for inclusion in the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Transportation Materials and Methods of Sampling and Testing,
(2) Design guidelines,
(3) Design specifications and commentary for inclusion in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications,
(4) Quality assurance guidelines, and
(5) Construction specifications and commentary for inclusion in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications.
These testing and material specifications made reference to the extensive and well-vetted testing program found within ACI 355.4 with a proposed exception for sustained-load testing. Design provisions for adhesive anchors in tensile loading were developed for AASHTO under given limitations. For cases that fall outside those restrictions, the designer was referred to ACI 318-11. Construction specifications were drafted for incorporation into the existing Section 29 �Embedment Anchors� of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications, which previously addressed adhesive anchors. Quality assurance guidelines were drafted to orient construction and inspection personnel to adhesive anchor installation.
The objective of this research is to develop and execute a plan for dissemination and successful application of research products presented in NCHRP Reports 639 and 757. For purposes of this project, �successful application� of the products is demonstrated by their adoption and use by practitioners.
The plan shall be directed at all types of anchors allowed in the eighth edition AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Section 5.13, with training on anchor behavior, code design provisions, anchor selection guidance, qualification of anchors, anchor specification and procurement, anchor installation, and quality assurance. The primary thrust is training in the practical, everyday use of anchors.
The dissemination and application plan shall present (a) a well-defined strategy for dissemination and application of the research products, (b) immediate actions that may be completed as a part of this project, and (c) longer-term actions that may be taken within a time period of no more than 3 years following the completion of this project.
The strategy for dissemination and application of the research results may have a time horizon longer than 3 years, and shall include at least the following components: 
(1) Identification of institutions and individuals that will take leadership in dissemination and application of the research products (i.e., an implementation team);
(2) Description of the audience or "market" for the products and a value proposition for their application by each principal audience segment;
(3) Realistic assessment of impediments and drivers to successful application of the products;
(4) Targeted technology transfer activities to achieve the project objective, such as, e.g., demonstration or pilot projects in host agencies, regional workshops and peer exchange meetings, creation of a �community of�� interest�, development of promotional materials, etc.; and 
(5)� Assessment of the potential for further implementation of the products of NCHRP Reports 639 and 757 and their ongoing impact, including identification of specific challenges and remaining gaps that can inform future application of the products.
The immediate and longer-term action components of the plan should be detailed (e.g., number of workshops, participants, pilot projects, presentations, etc.) and explicit regarding responsibilities of implementation team members. The contractor shall be responsible for recruiting implementation team members and ensuring that the members are aware that their responsibilities may continue beyond the contract period of the project.

    <abstract>The Montana Department of Transportation has found concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) piles connected at the top by a concrete pile cap to be a very cost effective support system for short and medium span bridges. This type of system offers low initial cost, short construction time, low maintenance requirements, and a long service life. While the gravity load performance of these systems is well understood, their strength and ductility under extreme lateral loads (e.g., seismic events) is more difficult to reliably predict using conventional design procedures. The proposed research aims to further develop newly established design and analysis methodologies, and to ultimately ensure the desired bridge performance.

The primary objective of this project is to further validate/improve MDT�s CFT to concrete pile cap connection design/analysis methodologies, and to ensure the efficacy of these methodologies for a wide variety of potential design configurations. This research will include physical tests of scaled specimens, which may include specimens with variations in cap dimensions, CFT diameter, or number of embedded piles. Additionally, the use of battered piles or precast concrete pile caps in this system may be explored experimentally. The exact scope of this project will be further developed through collaboration with the technical panel at the next stage of the proposal.

    <abstract>Whether to use corrosion protection of steel bridges is one of the largest decisions that can be made during design because it will ultimately affect the life-cycle cost due to various maintenance actions throughout the life of the bridge. However, the various protection schemes of zinc coatings (i.e., galvanizing, metalizing, and zinc primers) all have variable lives, which are challenging to predict, based on the macro- and micro-environments of a bridge. In marine and heavy industrial locations, even the best 3-coat, zinc-rich paint, or galvanizing can break down and require maintenance every 25 to 30 years. With a push to increase service lives of bridges out to 100 years and beyond, in severe environments, between two and five substantial maintenance actions could be required to attain the design lives. Many attempts have been made through research to develop more corrosion resistant alloys (i.e., weathering steels) or coatings for bridge applications. However, historical performance has shown that despite these attempts, areas beneath joints and/or in severe environments still result in corrosion of the steel and require continual maintenance. 


The only steel alloys that will actually remain corrosion-free for a 100-year service life in any macro- and micro-environment are stainless steels. While these alloys are typically four to six times the cost of A709 Grade 50W, the ability to remain truly maintenance-free for a lifetime makes the alloy competitive in a life-cycle cost analysis. In less severe environments, there may be an advantage to using just stainless alloys in targeted locations (i.e., near joints and abutments) and creating a hybrid girder of A709 and stainless steel. Besides the issue of first cost, the other major obstacle to using stainless steel for bridges is a general unfamiliarity with the material in design, fabrication, and construction that is not addressed in any AASHTO specification. 


The objective of the research project was to develop guidelines and/or specifications to help designers and fabricators use stainless steel in the superstructure of highway bridges.</abstract>
