  "title": "Evaluation of Metalized Stainless Steel Clad Reinforcement",
  "abstract": "The ongoing problem of corrosion of reinforcing steel in bridge decks has been addressed in South Dakota with increased concrete cover over reinforcement and the use of epoxy-coated rebar (ECR). To date, these measures appear to have worked well extending bridge deck life significantly. With the development of new materials and technologies, there maybe a potential for increasing deck life and/or reducing the amount of concrete cover on bridge decks. One of these new materials is a 316L stainless steel clad reinforcement manufactured by using a metallizing technique called the Osprey Process. This clad steel may be much less susceptible to corrosion than black steel or ECR, and may provide the means of preventing corrosion caused by deicing salts from occurring throughout the life of a structure. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential corrosion resistance, mechanical properties and uniformity of the SMI-316 SC&amp;Ocirc; using laboratory tests. Based on the results of these tests, South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) may design, construct and evaluate a bridge deck reinforced with this Corrosion-Resistant Steel. All test results will be compared with those from epoxy-coated reinforcement and mild steel using the same protocols developed in SD2001-05 Evaluation of Corrosion-Resistant Reinforcing Steel. The research will provide information on the constructability and effectiveness of this Corrosion-Resistant Steel for use in bridge decks as well as performance, service life and cost-effectiveness data. The objectives of this research project are to: (1) Determine the corrosion-resistance of the SMI-316 SC&amp;Ocirc; compared to ECR reinforcement; (2) Determine the mechanical properties, quality and suitability of the SMI-316 SC&amp;Ocirc; for use in bridge decks; and (3) Estimate life expectancy and cost effectiveness of the SMI-316 SC&amp;Ocirc;, ECR and mild steel reinforcement in South Dakota.",
