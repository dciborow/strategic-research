  "title": "Performance of drilled shaft under combination of complicated loads under hurricane event",
  "abstract": "As many studies have manifested that drilled shafts behave significantly differently under combined loads, this study focuses on investigating the lateral response of a drilled shaft that is subjected to a combination of vertical and lateral loads. In particular, this study is limited to assess the condition that the vertical load is applied prior to the lateral load. This scenario occurs to a drilled shaft supporting a bridge is subjected to hurricane load. Therefore, large-scale testing and numerical simulation will be performed to assess the effect of load ratio, drilled shaft head fixity, and cyclic loading on the lateral response of a drilled shaft built in stiff clay when a vertical load is present. Based on the data, the effect will be quantified in term of lateral deflections under different conditions. In addition, this project will focus on modifying the existing p-y curves to assist the analysis and design of drilled shafts that are subjected to combined vertical and lateral loads. This project will provide urgently needed information to address the safety and sustainability of the critical infrastructures of Region 6, as drilled shafts are widely used to support bridges, and retaining walls.",
