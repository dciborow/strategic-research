  "title": "Study on Structural Performance Evaluation of Double-Tee Bridges",
  "abstract": "The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a better understanding of structural performance of in-service double-tee (DT) bridges loaded with actual trucks. The objectives of this project to achieve this goal are: 1) To identify damage of typically used DT bridges; 2) To determine live-load distribution and dynamic load allowance factors of the DT bridges; and 3) To investigate load-carrying capacity of the DT bridges.",
